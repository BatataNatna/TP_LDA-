0,"DAYTON, OH—While greeting the crowd at a campaign rally Thursday, former President Donald Trump was seen kissing a supporter’s burger, according to sources in attendance. “Well, who’s this juicy little guy?” asked the GOP presidential candidate, who then reportedly lifted up the fully loaded flame-broiled beef hamburger with both hands and pressed his lips to its sesame seed bun, emitting an audible “muah.” “What is he, about 6 ounces? I wish you could vote for me, but you’re just an adorable little tasty burger, aren’t you? Aren’t you? Precious. I could take a big bite right out of you! Reminds me of my own sandwiches back home.” Sources confirmed Trump’s handlers eventually had to intervene so that he would release the burger from his grip and let the rally attendee finish eating it."
1,"Presidential candidate Donald Trump recently remarked that if he loses the 2024 election it will “be a bloodbath for the country.”The Onionexamines what he might have meant by the statement. Pretty straightforward, honestly. Stabbing and stabbing and stabbing with a sharp, blood-stained knife can often get messy. At least he came right out and said it. Awwwww! Look at that little droopy face! Look at it! No need to panic. Trump doesn’t plan on committing violence against anyone other than his loved ones. When Trump hosted the popular reality television program, he famously referenced the bloodshed of his enemies and called immigrants animals. What you interpreted when you heard him predict a bloodbath says more about you than about Trump. He was merely holding up a mirror to your subconscious. The rally caught him in a moment of panic after using the restroom. Although the ‘bloodbath’ comments sound alarming out of context, Trump was simply threatening to personally lock the doors of the Ford plant with everyone inside and light it on fire. Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter what Trump said—it only matters how he made you feel. Trump was referring to the fact that if he is not elected in November, Democrats will set up special booths in Chili’s where only bald men can sit and talk about bald things. Looks like he’s having one of his episodes. Better tie him down so he doesn’t hurt himself. Due to Trump’s propensity to deliver speeches in the more literary Old Church Slavonic, subpar translators often take creative liberties. The threat of violence is not conditional—it’s assured! Losing the election means he’ll have even more time to play, which could cause the lines between reality andGrand Theft Autoto blur even more. In order to elicit sympathy, Trump was trying to say that if he lost, he was going to slit his wrists in the tub for real this time. Trump is a massive fan of Opeth, Katatonia, and Paradise Lost, so when you put their members together? That’s a match made in hell. If Biden emerges victorious in 2024, Trump has threatened to wear his vampire dentures and bite Democrats’ necks. Trump’s allies said he was extremely nervous that Biden would trip, fall, and accidentally break something if he wasn’t careful. On day one of his second term, Trump has vowed to order every single one of his supporters to converge on Red Cross headquarters and donate several liters of blood. He’s keeping a gigantic blue marlin alive in a tank to drown his sorrows with should the election not go his way. All the stress of losing would calcify small stones in his ureter and cause him to pee blood. This is exactly what happened last time Melania let him watch it. He keeps trying to clarify this, but the media keeps spreading lies and calling it a gaffe. Run."
2,"And the RNC is going to pay for it. It probably won’t work, but it’s worth a shot. It’s been a few weeks. Lara believes segregating the office will streamline discrimination. The best start to any day, regardless of plans to overthrow democracy. We’re so sorry, Mr. Trump—you just missed your wife on her way out to lunch. Chair just sounds so much more impressive than co-chair. If you think the migrants will have it bad, you have no idea what’s in store for the walnuts. First and foremost, Lara Trump wants to make loads and loads of cash from this sweet gig. D.C. is expensive, and with Donald Trump’s legal bills to pay, it really makes more sense to relocate to somewhere like Knoxville and save on rent. It will be important to have plenty on hand at any given moment for the plans her team has in store. The medspa gives her a 15% discount for every referral she sends their way. Insult loves injury. To make her stance against the gender-fluid population clear, Lara Trump will take a huge enough dump to make the gender-neutral toilets unusable. In order to cut costs, human resources will be replaced with a man who comes up behind employees and feels them up without their consent. It happens to everyone. Lara Trump plans to dry heave until she vomits bile every time she looks at her phone and sees her husband calling. GOP voters are more comfortable with Laura, which sounds whiter. It’s important she gets straight to work on the official RNC duties. To be fair, it’s in the job description. Powerful positions in this country have their perks. Sorry, Eric, she’s pulling an all-nighter in the office again with the handsome young intern."
3,"VANDALIA, OH—Drawing criticism for what many called his dehumanizing and hurtful rhetoric, former President Donald Trump gave a campaign speech in Ohio over the weekend in which he referred to migrants as “Dons and Erics,” according to sources in attendance. “There are millions of these Dons and Erics pouring over the border, poisoning the blood of our country,” said Trump, whose words were condemned as “sickening” by immigrants’ rights groups for equating Latin American families seeking asylum with adult Trump sons. “These Dons and Erics—they’re not people. They are animals just looking for a handout. They’re drug addicts. They’re rapists. And they have no place in this country or in my family.” Trump reportedly went on to add, “They’re not sending their Ivankas, that’s for sure.”"
4,"WASHINGTON—Her mind spinning as she poured over the sheaf of papers, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly discovered classified documents Friday revealing that she is an android created by the DNC. “Wha—no, it can’t be,” said Harris, whose mouth hung open in shock, too horrified to scream after accidentally stumbling upon a blueprint in a musty cabinet in a back room of the West Wing for a humanoid robot labeled ‘K. Harris Model 3.’ “That looks like me. But, but, I’m me. Right? What about my parents? My memories? I thought I was a child once—wasn’t I?” At press time, a horrified Harris had startled and dropped the documents after Biden suddenly appeared behind her in the doorway."
5,"PALM BEACH, FL—Telling reporters about his revamped beauty routine as he lavished praise upon the social media platform he once tried to ban as president, a Vaseline-covered Donald Trump publicly reversed his stance on TikTok Monday after getting really into skincare. “You can’t get rid of TikTok when so many people love it and it’s providing me with so many tips on how to keep my skin moisturized and looking radiant,” said the face-taped former president, explaining that the only thing the Chinese-owned app could be found guilty of was making him look 40 years younger. “These people who say it’s a threat to national security clearly don’t know anything about dermaplaning or the latest hybrid cleansers. Forget about China—we need to be paying more attention to all the amazing new barrier creams and skin ampoules coming out of Korea.” At press times, sources confirmed the cash-strapped presidential candidate was struggling to fund his campaign through the sale of Trump-branded skincare products in the TikTok Shop."
6,"WASHINGTON—Taking every possible opportunity to lean over to the House speaker’s side of the desk and point at the back of Joe Biden’s head, Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly whispered “I know him” to Mike Johnson during Thursday night’s State of the Union address. “Psst, hey Mike, I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but I actually know that guy because sometimes I see him when we’re both working at the White House,” said Harris, who, despite Johnson’s repeated shushing throughout the approximately one-hour speech, quietly bragged that they had actually just seen each other earlier in the day at a big secret national security briefing, and that she even had his phone number in case of emergencies. “It’s not really a big deal, but technically, he’s my boss, so we kind of have to see each other all the time. I think if we play our cards right, I could maybe introduce you after. Just don’t be weird when you meet him, even though he’s the president of the United States of America.” At press time, Biden had interrupted his speech, whipped around, and demanded that Harris stop whispering, at which point she proudly looked at Johnson and mouthed, “See?”"
7,"WASHINGTON—Deteriorating before the eyes of a nation until he was nothing more than fine particles of sediment on the floor next to the podium, President Joe Biden appeared to crumble to dust Thursday night during his State of the Union address. “My fellow Amer—” the president said in what would be his final address to a joint session of Congress, his body beginning to lose all corporeal integrity as cracks formed in his face and spread downward through his neck and torso, the scraps of dry skin and bones deteriorating into smaller and smaller pieces of decayed matter until there was nothing left of him but the mere dust from whence he sprung. “What the heck? I… Well, shit.” At press time, a draft from the Capitol’s ventilation system had reportedly blown a significant portion of Biden remains into the faces of Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Mike Johnson."
8,"In last week’s Michigan’s Democratic primary, more than 100,000 voters cast their ballots as “uncommitted” in protest of President Joe Biden’s support for Israel in its war in Gaza.The Onionexplores the pros and cons of participating in a protest vote against the 2024 Democratic ticket. Feels nice to momentarily believe your vote matters. Still have to go and vote. Good cover if you forgot the names of all the candidates. Is it two M’s and one T or something else? Sends a powerful message to Nate Silver. More texts from the Biden campaign. Still get sticker. Gets Cornel West’s hopes up. Easily the most qualified candidate on the ballot. Pointless exercise when the process is clearly rigged for Dean Phillips."
9,"THE INFINITE—In a dominant electoral showing that stretched across the unified field of consciousness, author and politician Marianne Williamson successfully primaried President Biden Tuesday in all 63 counties of the Astral Plane, according to cosmic sources. “This win is sure to impact Williamson’s candidacy—not just on the Astral Plane, but on all theoretical planes of existence,” said 894Z0LP7, an ethereal projection of a political analyst from the Astral Plane, confirming that Williamson had far surpassed the votes for Biden, Rep. Dean Phillips (D-MN), and Zorbog the Blissful. “All the ballots of the outer dimension have been verified by the all-knowing cosmic egg, and the winner is clear: Williamson earned nearly 99% of the moons and stars from an amorphous population of transcendent souls, crushing the low-vibrating competition across the entire metaphysical vacuum. The incorporeal bodies have spoken—Williamson is the only presidential candidate who will enact real change in the quantum gap between being and nothingness. It’s a major upset for Biden, who will need to manifest a lot more focused psychic energy if he hopes to appeal to atmospheric demographics in the future.” At press time, Williamson’s campaign was attempting to downplay reports that she was polling behind Trump among both spiritual essences and disembodied flesh in the Bardo."
10,"PALM BEACH, FL—Repeatedly opening and closing the browser window for his bank’s website, former President Donald Trump told reporters Monday that he was scared to check his credit score. “I can’t do it—I just can’t do it,” said Trump, who admitted that he hadn’t paid off his credit card in weeks and grimaced as he imagined the animated dial on his screen pivoting even further counterclockwise. “It already wasn’t great, especially after all that Trump University stuff, but now? It’s going to be rock bottom, I just know it. I’m never going to recover from this. I could open up another account in Barron’s name, but I’m pretty sure I already tanked his credit too.” At press time, Trump had reportedly responded to his credit score by hurling his computer across the room."
11,"WASHINGTON—In what many of his congressional colleagues have described as the most noble act of his storied career, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) announced Thursday that upon his death, he would donate his body to lobbyists for research. “By studying this extraordinary specimen capable of such tremendous feats of opportunism, lobbyists will gain great insights into the human capacity for corruption,” said Don Stewart, McConnell’s deputy chief of staff, explaining that lobbyists would be able to take what they learned from the remains of a seven-term senator without scruple and discover new ways to buy and pay for lawmakers. “They will be asking questions like: How much influence can the human body peddle? Was there something unique in Sen. McConnell’s genetic makeup that allowed him to engage in shameless obstructionism and fight against campaign finance reform for all those decades? And is this a quality that can be replicated in future generations of congressional leaders? The advances for the field of lobbying could be quite profound.” Reached for comment, top D.C. lobbyists said the donation of the senator’s body would finally allow them to pinpoint the exact location of the great emptiness inside of McConnell that could only be filled with cash."
12,"The former president has relied on a variety of tactics to slow down proceedings in his numerous trials.The Onionexamines Donald Trump’s best excuses for delaying legal hearings. Oh darn, it’s one of those days when doors don’t open or close. Trump has successfully pushed back the date of several trials by claiming he is still one year away from being born. It’s really stupid and annoying going to a trial, and frankly, it sucks. And the people who are making him do it suck. And the only way that wouldn’t be the case is if they delayed things. Trump has shown up to court several times doing a terrible approximation of what he believes Hungarian sounds like. He claimed the Japanese experimental artist slept with his counsel and distracted him from doing his best legal work. He’ll look like an idiot in the court sketch if he goes in with this stain! Ow, it really hurts! Hold on—no. This is serious. Give him a second so he can figure out what’s going on. Trump’s attorneys have argued that the former president is currently in the middle of a leisurely lunch that could run well into 2025. Instead of fixing their marriage and teaching him to empathize with what it’s like to be a female immigrant from Slovenia, it just made him late to court. And unfortunately, the melting skeleton does not negotiate after it makes up its mind. While he wished he could be tried for election interference, he unfortunately could not find his way out of the Devil’s Triangle, where his ship had disappeared under mysterious circumstances. His aides are putting him back together as quickly as possible, but give him a break here. After fixing the bone spurs in his heels that prevented him from fighting in the Vietnam War, he’s finally been drafted into the U.S. Army. It was $20 plus tip, so he didn’t want to mess it up. Celebrating his covenant with God by being circumcised was booked months in advance. He’ll appear before the judge as soon as it’s finished. The juicy pear got all over his face, making him too sticky to stand trial. He said the sexual tension between him and Judge Tanya Chutkan was too strong for him to be able to stand trial. The thought alone of having to testify in front of all those people makes Trump nervous enough to throw up. PBS just started airing an episode based in Newport, RI that he’s been waiting to watch for weeks. TheSesame Streetcharacter makes learning to use the potty less intimidating and stressful for Trump. Trump successfully claimed he could not attend several of his New York court dates because he was currently on ice at the morgue. And then they grew way too big in the dryer. Years of singing, acting, and dreaming have finally gotten Trump his break on the big stage, and no criminal trial will take that from him. Trump’s self-esteem got too low for him to stand trial after he saw an unflattering angle of himself playing golf. Trump’s maternal grandfather, Malcolm MacLeod, just passed away last night, and even though they were never really super close, his mom says he still has to go. He used it to get out of several Cabinet meetings while president, too. President Trump is frantically attempting to finish the classic Frank Herbert novel beforeDune: Part Twocomes out in theaters, and there’s no way he’s ever going to get through the 800-page behemoth at this rate. Going to probably take another few months to soften up enough to be swallowed. The delay came when it ended up pulling his whole body through, requiring a lot of tape to stick the strips of him back together in the right order. If you let him delay forAntiques Roadshowonce, you need to let him do it again. That’s the law. How can he stand trial if he can’t understand a single word anyone is saying? Melania refused, Barron’s scared of them, and the former president doesn’t have any extra cash for a sitter. You can try to bring Trump the man to court, but it’s in Trump the mighty oak tree that the former president’s corrupted soul resides."
13,"COLUMBIA, SC—Claiming she still had a quarter tank and was ready to fight, Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley vowed Friday to remain in the race until her campaign bus ran out of gas. “To the critics who say I should drop out, let me be clear: I am in this race for as long as it takes for my campaign bus’s gas gauge to read empty,”said Haley, pointing to her impressive fundraising numbers, which have reportedly allowed her to have an extra 5-gallon gas can on hand. “Whether it’s on the side of I-95 or at a rest stop in rural South Carolina, I will continue our movement until there aren’t even fumes left to run on. We will never give up, though our bus’s engine might.” At press time, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon was seen giving Haley a piggyback ride to her next campaign event."
14,"PALM BEACH, FL—Closing his eyes and letting his mind wander, former President Donald Trump was reportedly daydreaming Monday about what he would do if he were rich. “Can you imagine never having to worry about money ever again?” said Trump, who smiled as he slipped into the ideal imaginary world in which he could leave his presidential campaign behind and simply spend the rest of his life lying on a warm, sandy beach halfway around the world with a virgin mai tai in his hand. “I could basically do whatever I wanted. I wouldn’t have any debt. I wouldn’t read the news. I’d wake up whenever I wanted, eat whatever I wanted, and never have to worry about Melania leaving me.” At press time, Trump’s daydream had been abruptly interrupted by an aide informing him it was time to go on stage."
15,"WASHINGTON—Ignoring his better judgment so as not to be called a chicken, President Joe Biden reportedly fell through a sheet of ice and plunged into dangerously cold water Monday after his buddies dared him to walk on the frozen Capitol Reflecting Pool. Sources confirmed the commander-in-chief’s chums had bet him $5 he couldn’t make it across the pool without chickening out, to which Biden responded, “Oh, yeah? Watch this.” The president is said to have taken only a few steps before breaking through the thin ice, sinking below the surface, and failing to reemerge for quite some time. According to reports, his friends’ playful laughter quickly dissolved into concern, at which point everyone in attendance scattered home so as not to get in trouble. At press time, witnesses confirmed first pet Commander Biden had fearlessly bounded onto the ice, grasped the drowning president in his jaws, pulled him to safety, and then ripped him to bloody shreds."
16,"WASHINGTON—Moments after pulling shut the door to the Roosevelt Room and locking it behind her, a terrified Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly told aides to “Stab him! Stab him, you cowards!” on Friday after she plunged a knife into President Joe Biden’s back. “What are you waiting for, you fools? Strike now! Strike before the opportunity goes cold!” said the blood-dappled vice president, who, as her staff appeared to grow uncertain of the blades in their shaking hands and backed away toward the exit,  reminded each panicked aide in turn that they had pledged their fealty for this day. “Think of all I’ve promised you. Think of all we stand to gain. Quick, now, the first blow has been rendered. There is no going back. We’re confederates in this. We must act now or be damned by inaction!” At press time, sources confirmed President Biden had complained to an assistant of a tightness in his shoulder and returned to the Oval Office with the knife still protruding from his back."
17,"Former President Donald Trump recently said during a rally that he’d invite Russia “to do whatever the hell they want” to members of NATO that had not paid their dues.The Onionasked Republicans why they were downplaying Trump’s remarks, and this is what they said. “He obviously would never have said something so reckless without clearing it with Russia first.” “Who cares if Russia attacks NATO? Most Americans, myself included, couldn’t point to the country of NATO on a map anyway.” “Is it an organization, or is it a treaty? They got to make up their mind.” “Donald was simply ringing a warning bell. God I love bells, don’t you? Cowbell, handbell, full circle, and carillon. of course. Have you heard a bonshō? Or an agogô? God, they are all just incredible. I just can’t get enough of those things.” “Oh, so we’re judging people by what they believe now?” “I’d like to see even more loan-sharking tactics in politics.” “Jeopardizing a longstanding military alliance shows that he’s fun and spontaneous.” “A Russian attack on NATO would inspire some fabulous war movies.” “The former president obviously didn’t mean exactly what he said, unless he did, in which case I’m also 100% behind him.” “He said nothing wrong. I agree with him that NATO is the enemy of our glorious motherland, Russia.” “When Trump is reelected, he will adopt a more responsible tone and only incite civil wars.” “At this point, I would be worried if he didn’t make reckless statements with catastrophic implications.” “But I thought Democrats liked funding endless wars.” “By now, I’m way past any ethical or intellectual qualms about just repeating what Trump says.” “That’s just Trump the candidate. We have no idea what kind of president he’d actually be.” “If you know a better way to bring about Judgment Day, I’d like to hear it.”"
18,"WASHINGTON—After top advisors patted his head and called him a good president, Joe Biden was rewarded with extra time on his tablet  Thursday, according to sources within the West Wing. “Since you were so patient and quiet all the way through the  National Security Council meeting, you can play on the iPad for 30 minutes,” said White House aide Will Ortiz, handing the president a tablet housed in a shockproof case intended to prevent him from getting the device sticky or accidentally cracking it as he sat on the floor of the Oval Office with a tube of Go-Gurt and enjoyed his screen time. “Now remember, you can only use the apps [chief of staff] Jeff [Zients] put on there for you, okay? If you download YouTube or anything like that, we’ll have to ground you from any official presidential engagements.” At press time, the national debt had reportedly skyrocketed after Biden purchased trillions of dollars’ worth ofFortniteskins from the app store."

20,"NEW YORK—Refuting claims that his references to recent conversations with deceased politicians were made by mistake, President Joe Biden confirmed Thursday that he speaks to dead European leaders all the time as they beckon him toward the light. “That was not a gaffe—I distinctly remember Helmut Kohl telling me the other day that it was time to let go and step into the light,” said the 81-year-old commander in chief, adding that a glowing apparition of Kohl appears to him at the end of a tunnel all the time, typically summoning him to the other side with a peaceful come-hither motion. “Despite what my critics would have you believe, I maintain an active relationship with Helmut and Francois [Mitterrand], and often take counsel from them on crossing over to the spirit realm, as well as other various matters of politics. Just the other day, they were whispering to me that all of this suffering and toil will soon be over once I accept the warm embrace of eternal rest. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to walk up that gleaming staircase to greet my late mother, Queen Elizabeth, and St. Peter, all of whom are waving at me from that fluffy cloud.” At press time, President Biden had clarified that, to be fair, former German chancellor Angela Merkel has also tried to convince him many times to give up his corporeal form."
21,"LAS VEGAS—In a significant blow for the presidential candidate’s already beleaguered campaign, Nikki Haley lost Nevada’s Republican primary Tuesday to the alternative option of “I’m Trans and You Can Take My Guns,” according to the final tally of votes. “It’s a major upset for Haley to have nearly 63% of conservative voters casting their ballot for the phrase ‘I’m Trans and You Can Take My Guns,’” said political analyst Shawn Benninghoff, who noted that the loss to the nine-word pro-trans and anti-guns statement was a particularly stunning defeat given that leading GOP candidate Donald Trump did not even take part in the state’s primary. “What should really raise questions about the viability of this campaign is that she was also edged out by the write-in options of ‘I Love Hunter Biden’ and ‘I am a Pedophile and Love Drinking Adrenochrome.’ You’ve really got to ask who this presidential run is even for at this point.” At press time, the Haley campaign had reportedly attempted to reach out to “I’m Trans and You Can Take My Guns” to ask if it was willing to be her running mate."
22,"WASHINGTON—Noting  that such violent ambushes had skyrocketed over the years he’d been in office, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) pushed for legislation Wednesday to combat stagecoach robberies. “While Democrats remain soft on crime, these dastardly bandits continue to roam the plains, robbing our nation’s hardworking prospectors blind,” said Grassley, who called on the government to crack down on the rampant violence preventing thousands of brave ladies and gentlemen from hitting the dusty trail and seeking gold out west. “As long as these mustachioed outlaws continue to hop into  wagons, spook the horses, and make off with their weight in jewels and other finery, no one is safe. This is what happens when Joe Biden defunds the sheriff.” Grassley also made an impassioned plea that the National Guard be dispatched in order to find and kill Butch Cassidy."
23,"WASHINGTON—In an address from the White House carried live on television, President Joe Biden gave the nation the nuclear launch codes Monday in case anything were ever to happen to him. “Folks, I don’t plan on going anywhere anytime soon, but the fact is, I’m not always going to be around, and you need to be prepared to oversee our long-range and tactical nuclear weapons on that day,” said the commander-in-chief, who added that he had been holding onto the highly classified sequence of letters and numbers until he thought the nation was ready to responsibly operate its arsenal of 5,244 warheads. “Just write the codes somewhere safe so you don’t lose them. Because, listen, if I have to go away, you’re the president, understand? All of you are. Okay, you ready? The code is 3X52-4980.” At press time, the American public had reportedly launched an intercontinental ballistic missile at East Timor."
24,"DAYTONA BEACH, FL—Saying the event would mark a pivotal moment in the years-long conservative psyop, liberal conspiracy theorists claimed Friday that Kid Rock would endorse Donald Trump for president at this year’s Daytona 500. “Calling it now—on Feb. 18, Kid Rock takes the stage for a pre-race concert at Daytona and spreads Pentagon-planted conservative propaganda for Donald J. Trump,” said liberal conspiracy theorist Alex Graham, adding that it was no coincidence that the NASCAR Cup race had been “rigged” to secure Kid Rock’s attendance just as Trump geared up for his 2024 general election push. “Kid Rock has been falsely propped up by the government for decades in order to mobilize middle-aged conservative voters and direct them to do whatever the Trump campaign commands. Between him, Ted Nugent, and John Voight, Biden has no chance to win the election.” At press time, Graham also slammed Kid Rock for being a slut and a bad role model for liberals due to the fact that he was previously married to Pamela Anderson and owns machine guns."
25,"WASHINGTON—A new poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center offered a rare glimpse into the psychology of those who will decide the 2024 presidential election, finding that for the average voter, it couldn’t hurt if they woke up to Donald Trump or Joe Biden making them a big stack of pancakes. “I’m not saying it would tip my vote one way or the other, necessarily, but were either of those candidates to wake me up one morning with a plate of flapjacks drizzled in real maple syrup, that would be a very nice thing,” said registered voter Cameron Stroebel of Flagstaff, AZ, one of millions of Americans who is leaning toward Biden or Trump putting on an apron, saying “Knock knock, who wants a little treat?” and then entering the room with sweet, golden brown pancakes. “Obviously, this isn’t the biggest concern for me or anyone else in this country. But if one of themdiddo this, would I appreciate a pad of melty butter on top and a little saucer of blueberry compote on the side? Absolutely. Also, while I don’t know if Trump or Biden has staked out a firm position on this issue, I’d want both water and coffee, because I get thirsty in the morning. And—this is really a litmus test for me as a voter—it couldn’t be too early, because I like to sleep in. But a 10 a.m. stack of griddle cakes from the current or former leader of the free world? Nothing wrong with that.” Poll respondents also noted that in terms of how they planned to vote on Nov. 5, if there were some bacon on the side, then you’d be talking."
26,"WASHINGTON—Following a tip from the White House IT department, Vice President Kamala Harris was reportedly reprimanded this week for playingThe Sims 4on her work computer. “What the hell is that—is that supposed to be a model White House?” said an irate Jeff Zients, the chief of staff shaking his head in disgust as he peered over the vice president’s shoulder and observed the replica office she had created, which seemed mostly identical to her real one, except that it had a swimming pool with no ladder where three Sims were actively drowning, and that Harris’ Sim appeared to be a vampire who was also a detective. “I don’t care if the base game was free. When you’re at work, you work. I never want to see the EA app on this computer again. You delete this shit right now. Oh God, is that a pregnant werewolf?” At press time, sources confirmed Harris was sent home for the day after Zients discovered she had charged more than $200 worth of expansion packs to the White House credit card."
27,"WASHINGTON—Stating that it was as easy to prepare 330 million helpings as  one, President Joe Biden announced Thursday that he was reheating chili if anyone was interested. “I’m going to pop some chili into the microwave in a minute or so if anyone wants some,” said Biden, who raised his eyebrows as he gestured emphatically at the large container of leftover meat and beans and repeated “anyone want in on this?” “It smells good. I bet it tastes good, too. It’s from Tuesday, but it should still be good. Better, even. It gives the flavors time to mingle. Alright, last chance if anyone wants any. You’ll need to get past security to get into the White House, but I can arrange that.” At press time, Biden was attempting to entice the nation by shaking a bag of oyster crackers."
28,"EXETER, NH—Raising concerns about the role that political misinformation and deepfakes might play in the coming presidential contest, election security experts confirmed the existence of a fake Joe Biden robocall Monday in which the sitting president tells New Hampshire voters that he took a paternity test and he’s their dad. “Hey there, kiddo, this is President Biden and I need to tell you something about the identity of your real father and that’s going to be a real doozy—it sure was for me,” said the voice purporting to be Biden, which reportedly spends the nearly 73-minute fabricated robocall holding back tears as he tells voters that he had made mistakes, but now wants to make up for lost time. “Listen, bud, I’m so sorry I wasn’t there for your T-ball games. But I’m here now, and I love you so very much and I’d love to watch you swing that bat. So don’t go to the polls on Tuesday. Take a train to my house in Wilmington and we’ll hash this all out over a bowl of Jillie’s famous soup. She isn’t your mom, by the way. But that’s a whole different story.” At press time, election experts had reportedly caused widespread disappointment after telling New Hampshire voters that the real Biden had no intention of taking them to the zoo and buying them an ice cream cone."
29,"HAMPTON BEACH, NH—Greeting the video with a mixture of mild consternation and resigned acceptance, Republican voters across the nation reportedly shrugged Monday and said there was really nothing you could do after footage of Donald Trump molesting a deer emerged. “Look, did I personally want or expect to see this video of Trump wetly kissing a doe on the cheek and reaching for her groin—no, obviously not—but what am I supposed to do now? Stop supporting the guy?” said New Hampshire voter Anthony Palmieri, one of millions of Trump supporters who appeared unfazed and responded, “Basically, it is what it is,” after watching the 93-second video of the former president slapping a female deer’s rear end and asking if what he was doing turned her on. “I’ve been on the Trump train for almost nine years now. I’ve been through so much already. No, I didn’t need to see Trump’s arm disappearing inside a deer’s body. And I can’t really cobble together an explanation for what he was doing sticking his tongue in her ear. I guess I could say this is just something that would happen in a locker room? Or that the media made it up? Yeah, I guess I’ll go with that.” At press time, an increasingly confident Palmieri went on to stress that no one was even considering all the woodland animals President Joe Biden had probably molested."
30,"Donald Trump recently argued that presidents should receive “total immunity” from prosecution even if they commit crimes.The Onionasked Americans to explain why presidents should have immunity, and this is what they said. “Maybe if the position came with immunity, more people would want to be president, and we’d finally have some more viable options.” “As someone who benefits from immunity from the law, I have to say it’s fantastic.” “Because my name is in a lot of little black books that I’d hate to see go public over the course of a trial.” “Makes my job a lot easier.” “Because the president is not just a man, but a powerful otherworldly being forged in a realm of freedom and justice to watch over us. Who are we, mere mortals, to attempt to question such a spirit’s actions?” “The body is its own prison.” “Oh, I broke the law a lot—like, a lot a lot—and I would like to get away with it scot-free.” “I hope in my lifetime to see the first president to commit beastiality in office. And I don’t want him to go to jail.” “If the president can’t get away with outlandish acts of corruption and self-dealing, then what hope do the rest of us have?” “I’ve accomplished a lot of things in my 99 years on this planet, but I’ve never strangled a man with my bare hands.” “Because I said so, that’s why!” “I think it’s cruel and unusual punishment to lock up the elderly.” “Trump’s people called me and offered me $600,000 if I would say I supported it in this slideshow.” “Our prisons are overcrowded enough as it is.” “As someone who hates Democrats but loves Republicans, I just can’t see any situation where giving a liberal president unlimited legal immunity could turn out badly.” “Because when I grow up, I’m going to be a despotic autocrat!” “The laws of man have no meaning. Ethics is void. The universe is a cold and empty place, and our supposed laws are an attempt to patch over that fundamental reality. It’s come time to own up to that.” “All the courtroom drawings might give him body dysmorphia.” “Presidents should be treated no differently than the rest of us billionaires.” “It would make the presidents of all the other countries super jealous.” “American? I’m a British bloke! But downright chuffed I passed for a Yank.” “I used to think nobody was above the law, but then my therapist taught me the danger of thinking in absolutes.”"
31,"SACRAMENTO, CA—As an otherworldly glow emanated from the California governor’s meticulously sculpted coiffure, sources confirmed Friday that the pulsating hair product on Gavin Newsom’s head had taken control of his thoughts. “There will be no bills signed, no presidential campaign—there will only be hair,” said the disembodied voice emanating from the greasy, slicked-back mass atop Newsom’s skull, his hair reportedly growing into thick, powerful tendrils long enough to choke out his political opponents anywhere they might try to hide in the State Capitol. “There will be no clemency for those who refuse to succumb to the wet and shiny hair. With these mighty strands, I command the wildfires and the earthquakes, the droughts and the floods!” At press time, sources confirmed Newsom’s hair product had evicted several homeless people seeking shelter within the throbbing gelatinous nest upon his head."
32,"Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz recently claimed that the MAGA movement was replacing “Karens” with a more diverse base.The Onionasked Republicans to explain why they don’t need women voters, and this is what they said. “Winning the election is less important than repeating you’ve won the election until everyone believes it’s true.” “Judging by all the people I interact with, women are only 2% of the population.” “You ever seen the inside of one of those? Blech!!!” “Because I’m a subhuman vessel for male pleasure that lacks wants, needs, or desires.” “Who needs women when we’ve created such a diverse coalition of mentally unhinged men to carry us over the finish line?” “We’re working on overturning the 19th Amendment anyway.” “They’re so pretty. They make us nervous!” “Every woman you’ve ever met has entered this country illegally. Trust me. Ask a woman if you can see her papers. She won’t let you.” “Voters? Why would we care about voters? It’s not like the United States is an actual democracy.” “Men’s votes are biologically stronger. That’s a scientific fact.” “The only woman whose opinion I cared about was Selena. And she died a long time ago.” “Women voters are uptight, unlike tween voters, who are nothing but fun.” “To attract female voters, we would probably have to color the elephant logo pink and give it long eyelashes, and then we’d need to come up with a backstory for her. Maybe we’d call her Enid the Elephant and she’d be a mother of three adorable baby elephants. It’d just be such a headache.” “I need all of them as my backup singers.” “Women’s votes only count for half a vote anyways.” “With a riot mob like ours, we won’t need anyone’s vote in 2024.” ‘There are only, like, 300 or 400 women in the country.” “Women gave birth to every single member of ‘The Squad.’” “What does voting have to do with staging a coup?” “Because only white land-owning males can vote, duh.” “They have too much free will. That’s why I never let mine out of the shed.” “The only woman the Republican Party needs is Mommy.”"
33,"WASHINGTON—In an attempt to dupe others into believing she was in her office working rigorously at all hours of the day, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly rigged up a dummy Tuesday to look as if it were typing anytime someone cracked the office door. According to White House sources, whenever the door was opened even the slightest bit, the plastic mannequin—which sat in the vice president’s chair and was dressed in a blazer and long brown wig—began clumsily slamming its hands against the keyboard and shaking its head while a recording played of Harris stiffly saying, “Sorry, I’m busy.” Reports indicated that aides and even President Joe Biden initially fell for the elaborate setup, but staffers became suspicious after several of the dummy’s strings snapped, causing it to fly out of the chair, hit the ground, lose its head, and respond to questions with loud crackling static. At press time, aides had rushed to inform the Secret Service of the breach, only to find that the agents on duty had also been replaced with dummies dressed in suits and hooked up to strings."

I  swear. I know you’re probably already a lock for Trump. I get it. All  I’m asking is a minute to win you over. I can’t do it without workers  like you, Beth. So what do you say?

35,"ORILLA, IA—With flights grounded and roads buried under inches of snow, blizzard conditions in Iowa reportedly forced Republican primary opponents Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley to share a hotel room Friday. “Seriously? There’s not even a sofa?” said Haley, who groaned and returned DeSantis’ brooding scowl with a fiery glare of her own as the pair entered the cramped roadside motel room and surveyed its shabby conditions. “You’re not happy with this? Well, neither am I, Ron DeSantis! Believe me, this is the last place on earth I’d like to be right now! There’s no way in hell I’m sleeping on the floor, so let’s just put a blanket down the middle and agree not to cross that line. Now, I’m going to take a shower.

36,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to contrast himself with former President Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election, President Joe Biden reportedly played up his wholesomeness Wednesday by drawing freckles on his cheeks with a marker. “Why, hello, everybody—my name is Joey Biden,” the president said in an address from the White House in which he attempted to court voters  by standing before the cameras with his head tilted and his hands clasped innocently behind his back. “Aren’t I just cute as a button? I’m wearing new overalls. They’re a bit big, but Mama says I’ll grow into them. Now, who wants to hear a song?

Glenn Thompson (R-PA), chair of the House Agriculture Committee, who had criticized the program for providing low-income families with year-round groceries “by the bagful” instead of something more modest, like a small scoop of ice cream on their special day. “Now, a single food stamp will be redeemable on the date that appears on a SNAP recipient’s birth certificate, an original copy of which must be presented upon checkout at participating supermarkets. While Congress should continue  efforts to cut our federal government’s overgenerous entitlement programs, I do believe every American ought to enjoy a slice of cake, a fresh-baked cookie, or some similar treat to celebrate turning a year older.” Thompson added that the new bill also implemented a work requirement that limits eligibility for the free treat to individuals who have worked eight hours or more on their birthday."

I’m basically getting paid to catch up on all of the shows on the channels that I can’t afford—it rules.

Even a carefully placed mattress or pile of sofa cushions would do.

54,"WASHINGTON—Following an investigation into the candidate’s lackluster poll numbers, President Biden’s campaign has traced the source of the Democratic incumbent’s troubles to a really scratchy blanket that makes it hard for him to sleep, according to a copy of an internal memo obtained Tuesday by reporters. “All of our efforts to garner support for next year’s election are being undercut by a dry, prickly wool blanket that the president sleeps with every night,” read the memo from Biden campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodriguez, explaining that there was no way the commander-in-chief could operate at full capacity when he was up all night scratching his legs because the fabric was getting caught in his leg hair and “it feels like something’s creepy-crawling” on them. “He wakes up really grumpy and with watery eyes because of his slight wool allergy, and then he doesn’t want to do any campaign stuff. At the same time, the president refuses to spend money on a new blanket when he has what he calls ‘a perfectly fine one’ already. Everything that alienates voters about his presidency—the struggle to contain inflation, the broken promises on immigration, the way he is beginning to look his age—can be traced to his unwillingness to put a flat sheet or pajama bottoms between his bare legs and this ratty, rough piece of fabric that keeps him up. The president says an extra layer would make him too hot and only worsen the situation. Meanwhile, our research shows that Trump is getting eight and a half hours of sleep every night beneath a luxurious faux-fur throw. Our only hope is to double down on our efforts to fundraise for a better blanket—preferably something in a jersey or satin.” At press time, Biden’s poll numbers had plummeted even further after the scratchy blanket shrunk in the wash, leaving his exposed toes too chilly for him to sleep."

Just put your John Hancock right here above mine…and  there we go! Pretty cool, huh?

Also, he’s not even that hot. That’s the thing. He’s just this fugly  little skank. Plus, what he’s doing to the Uyghur people is abhorrent.  Almost as abhorrent as Xi blowing any and all takers.” At press time, Beijing had immediately condemned  the statement, remarking that the Chinese president’s body count was, like, two  at most."
59,"SAN FRANCISCO—Stressing that this was the best option given how prohibitively expensive all the Bay Area hotels were, sources confirmed Wednesday that President Joe Biden has been forced to share an Airbnb with three roommates during his visit to San Francisco. “While the president obviously would have loved to have his own private space, renting a queen-sized bed in an apartment in the Mission District just made the most financial sense,” said White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, adding that the Airbnb, which is located in the three-bedroom, one-bathroom apartment of a 28-year-old named Miko,  features a mini fridge, a shared shower, and access to a coffee maker for only $150 a night. “Yes, the president did have to make some concessions. For instance, he could not shower before his meeting with Xi Jinping today because Miko’s two roommates were hotboxing the bathroom, and Miko’s girlfriend kept giving him some serious side-eye. But at the end of the day, it was worth it for his speechwriters, Secret Service agents, and wife Jill to share the 11-foot-by-12-foot space. Otherwise, they would have all had to stay in a hotel in Livermore and drive over an hour into the city.” At press time, Biden was reportedly forced to take public transit after the presidential limousine failed to fit in the Airbnb’s tiny back-alley parking space and was subsequently towed."

Please note that since our Republican friends have removed metal detectors from the House floor, pulling out a gun and emptying several rounds of ammunition into your phone is also an option.” House leaders went on to state that if thoughts about a negotiated end to the violence entered the head of a staffer, they were instructed to smash their head by throwing themselves in front of an  oncoming Metro train."

It stands for freedom. The smell? That stands for American families. The bacterial infection my doctor warned will kill me? That’s for the unborn.

But the Green Party doesn’t seem to understand that. The historical parallels are terrifying. This could be just like in 2016 when Stein decisively tilted the election away from Gary Johnson.” Sutherland went on to stress that if this possibility didn’t frighten Stein into dropping out, she should consider the very real scenario in which her candidacy creates a President RFK Jr."

While we believe in free speech, this time, an overwhelming number of U.S. voters have taken it too far.” At press time, Johnson could be heard admonishing  Americans and warning that if they continued their antisemitic calls for ceasefire they would all be expelled from the country forever."

After all, if the president doesn’t win this time around, he’d still be eligible to run in 2028. And even if he never gets to be president again, there are plenty of other things Joe Biden can do besides occupy the Oval Office. So vote, don’t vote—we really don’t care.” Asked by reporters to name the campaign’s top priority, Chávez Rodriguez said her team was mostly focused on making sure the president didn’t die ahead of 2024."

You may not even understand why you’re feeling so depressed or anxious until you talk about it with a professional and identify the source of your troubles. I know you might think you have everything under control, but seriously, therapy can help.” Fetterman went on to tell the Gazan child that he shouldn’t be afraid to talk to his primary care physician about going on an antidepressant, noting that such medications have improved over the years and have fewer troublesome side effects like weight gain and loss of libido."

According to our research, U.S. voters were utterly confused, even when shown a photograph of Biden standing in front of the White House. Furthermore, only 5%of the 15%of Americans who had heard the name ‘Joe Biden’ reported that they had any opinion on him whatsoever.” At press time, the DNC was even more panicked after learning that Biden’s name recognition hovered at just 3%among registered Democrats."

We’ve given you how many tens of billions of dollars, and for what, retaking a couple bridges? When we started supporting you, we figured you’d get this wrapped up in six months or so, yet here we are a year and a half later and nothing doing.

97,"WASHINGTON—Following a Jacksonville, FL mass shooting in which a white assailant killed three African Americans, Democrats in the U.S. Senate introduced a bill Monday they said would address the continuing crisis of racially motivated attacks by removing all Black people from circulation. “The only way to prevent Black lives from being cut short by these hateful killers is to drastically reduce the number of Black people allowed in public places, where it is far too easy for them to be shot at,” a visibly moved Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said of the proposed measure, which his Republican opponents claimed would do little to remove the nearly 42 million Black Americans already on the street, arguing that if “a criminal is dead set on getting his hands on a Black person, he’ll find one—legally or otherwise.” “We have to start somewhere, and right now our priority should be making it as hard as possible for virulent racists like the Jacksonville shooter to access the Black people they’re trying to murder. Look at a country like South Korea, Japan, Poland, or Iceland, where shootings like this are very rare—that’s because there are so few Black people for would-be killers to target in the first place. I’m not naïve. I know this piece of legislation would only be the first step in controlling the spread of Black people, but a national registry is the simplest, most straight-forward way to keep track of the American Americans in our communities.” Schumer went on to outline a comprehensive buy-back program that would allow any American to turn in a Black person for a cash payment, no questions asked."

If you look closely at the debate footage, you can even see that Nikki Haley, whose dress was on backward, was holding her heels in one hand while ordering an Uber with the other.” Trujillo went on to state that by watching Mike Pence’s lips carefully, he could tell the former vice president was both praying for forgiveness and had recently eaten ass."

Help! Help!

Tim Scott, you’re good to go. Nikki Haley, I’m going to have to ask you to leave. Per GOP rules, you are not permitted to state your gender as ‘female’ and then enter the debate wearing a pantsuit.” At press time, Donald Trump, who refused to participate in the debate, argued that as a former president of the United States, his genital inspection should remain classified."

Ron DeSantis to follow during Wednesday night’s debate.The Onionexamines the best strategies  from the document. Voters love a well-lubricated mouth! If you start to get nervous, just run. Any direction, as fast as you can. It’s much better than having to stomach you trying to say something. If you aren’t willing to suffer, then do you even love the United States? Word choice is very important when referring to minority communities, and the term “Black” ensures everyone knows what you mean. (They kind of lost their temper here.) If you can hit all the high notes in this classic of the mezzo-soprano repertoire, then no one—absolutely no one—is going to question your right to be on that stage. A bona fide crowd-pleaser. Keep it chill, like you’re cruisin’ on the strip with your top down, shades on at night, the flashing city lights dancing to the infectious rhythms of the funky beat. You’re outta sight, jack, you’re outta sight. Better to let it all out in the bathroom afterwards than to give Vivek Ramaswamy the satisfaction of seeing how badly his words hurt you. A list of possible words DeSantis could use includes “when,” “made,” “but,” and “buckle.” The memo recommends the 2024 candidate attack the production company behind such films asGeostormandTransformers: Rise Of The Beastsat least three to five times throughout the evening. Everyone hates it when you laugh. Reminding the audience that he is still turgid every 15 to 30 seconds with a well-placed “I’m hard, by the way” or “Yup, still hard” will help the governor combat perceptions that he is weak. You don’t want to be labeled “Milky DeSantis” by rivals. Should you ever get overwhelmed by opponents bringing up your flagging poll numbers, simply start snapping and vocalizing nonsense syllables in time, getting louder and louder until everyone else goes quiet. Then you can take center stage and begin dancing around wildly! Remember that saying what is honest from deep down is always the right move. Just be your authentic self, and the right people will resonate with your message! Safety first! If you get nervous, you can piss your pants, but only make a little dot. Don’t let it be so much that it goes down your leg, allowing the other candidates to see or smell it. You did such a good job memorizing them, so if you get cornered, you can begin listing every U.S. state capital to show you’re more intelligent than your opponents. The PAC was hopeful that putting on a sexy British accent would make DeSantis sound smarter as well as distract from his overall appearance. Although a large, man-sized Mickey Mouse will be sitting in the debate audience staring directly at DeSantis and breathing heavily, the governor is not to make eye contact. Ultimately, the easiest way to connect with GOP voters. DeSantis was instructed to show dominance by walking up to his opponent, inhaling, and swallowing Ramaswamy in one fell swoop. According to the memo, DeSantis should make a fist, repeatedly punch himself in the face, and then scream, “An undocumented did this! An undocumented did this!” Even though he’s an opponent, DeSantis is only to refer to Trump as “our Heavenly Father” or “the one true God.” Christians Explain Why Jesus Was Too Liberal Everything Trump Did In Georgia To Try To Overturn The 2020 Election Conservatives Explain Why Libraries Should Be Defunded Homepage"

What a fucking pathetic excuse for an autocrat. While he’s not strictly responsible for the racist and classist bipartisan effort to curb democracy, he did a pretty thorough job coasting on it. He was forced to seek alternative measures due to long response times from police. Sadly, the fast-food chain was only able to provide him with around 200. The de-voting fluid may have caused as many as 30 pen-filled bubblevotes to evaporate. Trump was apparently misled t0 believethat marrying the governor means you automatically win the state. “I Am President, I Am President, I Am President.” Although botharchitects of the 9/11 attacks were confirmed dead decades ago, that didn’t stop Trump from trying todamageAtlanta DAFani Willis’ reputation. Reaching a point of desperation, Trump decided to make an ill-advised purchase of a macaque from Malaysiaand tried for days to instruct the monkey on how to identify which ballots were votes for Biden so he could steal them. Although the compromising photos of the voting machine were later discredited,the damage had alreadybeen done. Trump vowed that if Georgia pulled through for him, he would declassify all the secret government files about the shadowy figure we know as “George Washington.” His efforts were appreciated, but they had already cast their ballots. Luckily, they were pro–Grover Cleveland ballots from the election of 1884. Trump repeatedly pressured the media mogul to “find more votes” despite Perry repeatedly explaining that the BET seriesThe Ovalis purefiction. Shows how serious he was about staying president. Even though Trump didn’t necessarily truly believethis would have any bearing on the electionresults, he hedged his bets by explaining to his sons that committing a sin of the flesh would take away votes from their father. Even though he passed out before they blew off the table, his intention was the same. After hearing about what complete sluts Dominion voting machines are, Trump figured he could set up a littlequid pro quoarrangement to secure his win. He was really laying on the potential bribes thick. After everything he did to undermine the democratic process, Trump realized that he didn’t truly have to do anything, and thatjust being the immoral, spiteful demagogue he was would always be enough to erode fairness within the U.S. It’s unclear how this would have helped his quest for the U.S. presidency, but he was arrested for trespassing on the property several times nonetheless. Prohibited under Chapter 183-1 of the Georgia Election Code. He didn’t find anything that would have helped him overturn the election, but had a lot of fun just looking around regardless. Trump claimed the only real Biden on the ballot was him. Ouch. Unfortunately,Trump is still coming into his powers and lacks the mental strength necessary to move thousands of ballots with his mind. While almost certainly illegal, feasting on volunteers likely only had localized effects. Trump was smart to reach out to the shadowy GOP operatives who successfully stopped the count in Florida, but he may not have been persistent enough. Although the then-senator would have still voted for him, Trump reportedly wanted to make extra sure the vote was received. Trump reportedly created a diversion for Rudy Giuliani to copy confidential data from voting machines by walking into a police office in downtown Atlanta and confessing to kidnapping Charles Lindbergh in 1932.

And this  is just the beginning. Israel knows that if they normalize ties with the  Saudis, that raises the likelihood of other Gulf States joining them in  killing and maiming Palestinians.” At press time, Israel had reportedly  attempted to show its seriousness by beheading a journalist reporting  on the deal for an American newspaper."

By the end of the conversation, it was clear he’d secured the corn dog’s vote. He even gave it a hug.” At press time, crowds at the fair were reportedly shocked after Ron DeSantis approached a family, screamed something unintelligible, and took a bite out of their young daughter’s arm."

I realize that student debt cancellation has failed in the past, but if need be, I will make this same wish when I blow out the candles on my birthday cake this year. Other plans include picking the petals off one of these beautiful flowers and saying, ‘They’re canceled, they’re canceled not’ and, with any luck, ending on ‘They’re canceled’ with the last petal.” At press time, Biden had announced that his wish probably wouldn’t come true because he had told a gaggle of reporters representing every major news outlet in the nation about it."

Maybe he tries to strike up a conversation with a group of regulars and then realizes no one heard him and so he lapses into dead silence again.

Whether it’s accepting illicit campaign contributions, using official government resources for campaign purposes, or failing to properly file expenditure reports, we need evidence from news articles, video recordings, or official stationary that the candidate’s campaign is violating federal law in multiple ways. Alternatively, if a candidate is unable to reach the 20,000 campaign ethics violationsthreshold, we’ll make an exception if they can prove that they’ve personally committed at least a Class X felony embezzlement from their campaign funds.” The RNC also reportedly set as an additional requirement for debate qualification that all candidates must sign a pledge to commit ethics violations on behalf of the eventual Republican nominee."

DeSantis paused after he said this during a speech to open a new building at the Kennedy Space Center and got no applause for it. Not sure where he came up with this one. DeSantis personally thinks Jacksonville is Florida’s paradise. Conservatives denied this was homophobic, but read between the lines and it’s a pretty clear antigay dog whistle. He then went on an expletive-laced screed denouncing woke cetaceans. DeSantis subscribes to the fringe ideology that denies gay identity because there is no evidence in the fossil record of homosexual activity amongst dinosaurs. DeSantis often ends his stump speeches with a laundry list of pop culture gripes. At this point, he’s just trying to get assassinated.

Right now, Karen’s only making 40or 50grand. My daughter Charlotte is making 10on her best days. And that’s not even addressing how this could alter my book deals. Thankfully, the power of prayer steered me to the rightness of this choice. Yes, I’ve enriched myself so much from the vice presidency. But God said I’m not done making money.” Pence added that now all he had to do was sacrifice his eldest child atop an altar to secure the Lord’s promises."

It isn’t right that everyone in the store looked at me nervously, seeing only a vocal proponent of allowing citizens to carry concealed firearms everywhere they go. But unfortunately, that’s the way this country treats people of conservative values.” Scott added that on the way home from Walgreens that day, he was pulled over by police officers who, repeatedly and without cause, praised him for “driving while Republican.”"

A small contingent even worried the presidents would make jokes about them being on the toilet to fellow patrons. These are bleak results for the frontrunners heading into 2024—some of the lowest since the 1980 election, when most thought they would leave the bathroom to find Jimmy Carter wandering over and finishing their half-eaten sandwich.” The Pew poll did find, however, that many Americans would settle for Trump or Biden if the other clientele at the café were Ron DeSantis, Chris Christie, or Marianne Williamson."

And together, we will govern the afterlife!” At press time, Feinstein told sources she felt betrayed after discovering the phantasm of Kennedy was merely angling to be appointed to her vacant Senate seat."
164,"At least 13 states have passed laws banning gender-affirming care for trans youth, including life-saving treatments like hormone therapy and puberty blockers.The Onionasked politicians why they oppose gender-affirming care, and this is what they said. “I consider it sexual abuse, and I’ve decided I suddenly care about that.” “Whether you were born male or female, I’m opposed to the existence of genitals in all their forms.” “Seems like an easy way to annoy everyone who voted for me.” “To fulfill my pathological need to exert power over our society’s most vulnerable, obviously. Dumb question.” “It’s not up to young people to decide what gender they are. It’s up to my campaign donors.” “No child should ever be affirmed about anything, ever.” “None of my girlfriends have been mature enough to make such a life-altering decision.” “Allowing someone to feel comfortable and confident in their own body is something I’ve opposed since the beginning of my career.” “It gives the inaccurate impression that doctors do more than just prescribe opiates.” “It is a fact that the first sign of child abuse is a kid liking themselves.” “It’s unnatural for a teenager to alter their body in a way that makes me not attracted to them.” “There hasn’t been a single pro-gender-affirming lobbyist even trying to throw millions at me.” “Anything to keep voters’ attention off my state’s poverty, crime, economy, drug problems, schools, and police departments.” “That sounds suspiciously like healthcare.” “I believe in a small government that inspects children’s genitals.” “If we let people be themselves, what next? Anyone can grow a beard? No one needs to buy a fake beard? I have to find another way to unload this warehouse full of beards?” “You lost me at gender, then again at affirming, and finally at care.”"

Supporters were baffled and slightly disappointed by the former president’s request for this gentle act of protest. Careful with the base, there, Donny. Trump has maintained he was born in 2018. Prominent people aren’t supposed to say things like this, because people might actually listen to them. Disgusting. Although two for one seemed like a fair trade, the Manhattan district attorney apparently did not agree. There is no justice left regardless.

This is what Trump says to Barron whenever Barron wants to hang out. Trump said this after dropping his calzone. With statements like this, some have become concerned that Trump may be a narcissist. WhileThe Bendsmay include many great songs, as a composed album it doesn’t even come close to reaching the artistic highs ofOK Computer.

Like, maybe we start saying that the Manhattan grand jury is full of trans people. I don’t know, just a pitch.” “Wait, what? It takes so long for news to travel here from Washington.

No? Wait, seriously? How the fuck does the U.S. justice system function?” “It’ll be fine. Of course it’ll be fine. Why wouldn’t it be fine? I would let you hold me right now to make me feel safe.

Spencer Cox, who stressed that the sexual exploitation of teenagers was a very serious matter in Utah and should be carried out exclusively by elders in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. “We believe that intrusive questions about a teen’s sexuality should be asked behind closed doors by a bishop—not on some social media site by a stranger. And when that child is eventually blackmailed into sexual slavery, who better to oversee that process than a man who is highly respected in the community and represents an institution that is beyond reproach?” Cox added that the digital trail of evidence left behind by online predators also made it that much harder to orchestrate a cover-up of the abuse and pretend it never happened."

171,"WASHINGTON—Saying  the sender’s contributions were appreciated but ultimately  self-defeating, Capitol Police told reporters Wednesday that a  thoughtful letter on how to improve the legislative process was undercut  by the poison powder included in the envelope. “Although the anonymous  assailant’s note had some helpful feedback on how to break through  partisan gridlock, the deadly quantity of ricin spread on those pages  also makes you wonder how much he really believes in improving the  democratic process,” said Capitol Police spokesperson Jermaine Williams,  rushing to note that the letter itself was well thought out, thoroughly  researched, and expressed important points on places where Republicans  and Democrats might come together to advance bills on pharmaceutical  costs and energy permitting reform. “What’s especially nice is how much  constructive feedback it contains. Sometimes people can get really nasty  about politics. But, aside from a few typos, blood-stains, and the  toxic powder, this really seems to be coming from someone who cares  about these issues and wants to see the country do better.” Williams  added that the biggest shame was that all these interesting points would unfortunately be overshadowed by the three congressional  aides sent to the hospital."

Whisper it alone in a locked roomand the money’s yours. It  doesn’t even have to be in a positive context. Say,‘I don’t care about  climate,’ or,‘Huh, climate, what’s that?’ and you’ll receive billions of  dollars in the form of a grant or a tax cut, your choice. Now let’s get saying climate!” At press time, Biden added that he hoped the word climate would account for 70% of all words by 2032."

Ron Johnson (R-WI) and Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “Anything goes, okay? Scratching, biting, kneeing each other in the balls. Do whatever you want, we don’t give a fuck. Whoever wins this brawl can use this five bucks for their reelection campaign or a pet project in their district. But you can’t stop till we say so. Jesus, you guys are so fucking pathetic. This is worse than the time we gave [Sen. Tommy] Tuberville (R-AL) 25 cents to eat dog shit. Okay, let’s make this more interesting. An extra dollar for every good eye-gouge you can get.” At press time, sources confirmed Sen. Tim Kaine (D-VA) had been beaten to death and the lobbyists were posing for pictures with his corpse."

Should those on food stamps attempt to buy more rutabagas, they will be prosecuted under the full force of the law. This is actually quite generous when you consider how few rutabagas people in other countries are provided with.” At press time, Congress had reportedly voted to close the rutabaga loophole."

This isn’t merely an egregious violation of basic labor laws. Many of these cabinet secretaries are scared and don’t know where their parents are.” At press time, the White House had responded to such criticism by pointing to its many teenage cabinet members such as 17-year-old Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg."

Listen, the last thing I want is for you to miss out on this sweet deal. So give me one sec while I step into my office, and I’ll be back lickety-split. In the meantime, think about those heated leather seats. If I were you, I’d get them for the missus, but hey, I know you’re a smart guy. Just remember, if you put ink to paper today, I’m willing to toss in some top-notch secrets about Iran’s nuclear enrichment levels.” At press time, Biden had reportedly left the prime minister in order to rush into a side office, close the blinds, and begin a passionate argument on an unplugged phone demanding his boss let him make the deal."
177,"While the Fox News host is not necessarily known for being honest, text messages released in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit show that Tucker Carlson frequently lies to viewers.The Onionexamines Tucker Carlson’s biggest lies. Carlson has repeatedly claimed on-air that the QAnon Shaman had IBS and thus had no choice but to release his bowels all over Nancy Pelosi’s office, and that anyone who disputed this was simply being ableist. Tucker Carlson has been a registered member of the Green Party since 1991. No, there is hope: a young peasant girl from the village, as foretold by the prophecy. Tucker Carlson is a television host. He absolutely would, in a heartbeat. Bow tie cancer is exceedingly rare. This one is actually true. The Capitol building is boring as shit, and in a town with the Lincoln Memorial, the Smithsonian, and the National Gallery of Art, no self-respecting tourist would waste their valuable time sightseeing at the fucking Capitol building. Yet again, Carlson proves himself to be a lib in sheep’s clothing. It was only a shadow, although he did get scared. That was Brian Kilmeade. In fact, Carlson wears the blue, puffy shirt he wore on the program every single night to bed. While Carlson has regularly called for the deportation of illegal immigrants, his repeated attempts to use them to sell hair supplements is just pathetic. Far be it from us to disagree with the Lollipop Man; however, in this instance, he appears to be fibbing. Fauci and the novel coronavirus are work acquaintances and nothing more. He left MSNBC in 2008, not 2007. This one isn’t so much a lie as it is misleading, since it’s odd to single out Trump among the 3.5 million of his viewers he absolutely loathes. While it is unfathomable to think that not one but two people could find Tucker Carlson desirable, this one is true. This is what Fox was covering as the Jan. 6 insurrection took place. Carlson’s assertion that Covid-19 was created in a studio session during a Method Man verse is unsubstantiated. While technically true, it’s not for the reasons Carlson believes. Yet again, Carlson has mistaken himself for peanut butter. Information about the Brazilian three-banded armadillo is widespread and easy to find online. He just never figured out how to use it correctly. Whenever there’s a slow news day, Carlson claims the purple M&M met him when he was just 16 years old and immediately seduced him."

Ron DeSantis banned births in the state of Florida on Tuesday, citing the need to protect impressionable infants from exposure to vaginas. “No longer will we allow our innocent babies, in the first moments of their lives, to witness any obscenity, including the female genitalia,” said DeSantis, explaining that every time a person gives birth vaginally, child protective services will be called and the perpetrator will be charged with a felony for endangering a minor. “The radical left is trying to groom our nation’s young by having them pass through the birth canal, claiming that it’s natural and healthy. But here in Florida, we know that shoving a baby out of a woman’s vagina is pornographic, and we’re not going to tolerate it. Not on my watch.” At press time, state police had arrested millions of Floridians on charges of molestation, alleging they had exposed unborn children to their reproductive organs for up to nine months."

And why the fuck do I pay for coverage if it doesn’tcoveranything?

All Ensure shakes will be completely free.

Mark Warner (D-VA), adding that legislative work in the upper chamber of Congress had been brought to a virtual standstill because dozens of senators couldn’t stop scrolling through TikTok videos and bursting into tears. “We wanted to do some research into TikTok to see for ourselves how it threatens public security, but we all ended up addicted to watching weight-loss and dieting TikToks, which made us all feel really bad about our bodies. This app simply makes it far too easy for users, including all 100 United States senators, to develop depression and low self-esteem. Jon Tester (D-MT) just ran off saying he didn’t want to see anyone until he’s lost 20 pounds, Mitt Romney (R-UT) has been in the bathroom for over 90 minutes, and we just watched Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) eat an entire chocolate cake. Both Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Cindy Hyde Smith (R-MI) have unveiled big visual aids counting their calories, and the hashtag #WhatIEatInADay has been trending around the Senate. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has been doing crunches on the Senate floor, and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) is begging us all to follow her weight-loss journey on the app. TikTok is, without a doubt, a growing threat to a functional American society.” At press time, Congress had passed a massive bipartisan funding bill to purchase diet pills they saw on TikTok."

Sources confirmed that, for now, the serene woman was free to think about whatever she liked, as her mind would not be 100 percent preoccupied by reckoning with the phrase “President DeSantis” for another several news cycles, at which point she would be immediately bombarded with his opinions on the issues facing the nation from the moment she woke up in the morning until she tried and failed to fall asleep at night. Despite being mere weeks away from being plunged into a sea of thinkpieces, photographs, and sound bites centered on the Republican, the happy, satisfied woman was reportedly able to concentrate fully on work for the last time before her current placidity would come crashing down in a bombardment of hateful and regressive Ron DeSantis campaign ads."

186,"WASHINGTON—Advertising the event as a chance to interact personally with a conservative icon, organizers confirmed Thursday that the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference would feature a new exhibit where visitors could purchase and toss pieces of raw chicken to Rudy Giuliani. “This year, for $5 a pop, attendees will be treated to an up-close encounter with the former mayor of New York and given a thrilling opportunity to feed him a handful of his favorite food—raw chicken,” CPAC spokesperson Nancy Garner said as she stood outside a 9-by-12-foot enclosure that contained a warming lamp, a sunning rock, a water feature, artificial plants, and the disgraced onetime U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. “Can you see him? Those are his heavy-lidded, bloodshot eyes peeking out from under that rock. He may look harmless now, but don’t be fooled. He’s still feral. Be sure to step back as soon as you release the chicken, because he’s going to leap forward and grab it with a big jowly chomp before it even hits the ground. And if you think that’s neat, watch what happens when you throw a few airplane bottles of blended scotch into the cage! Video is allowed, but please refrain from flash photography, as he is quite old and easily disoriented. That’s how Kelly Anne Conway was bitten earlier.” At press time, CPAC was reportedly on lockdown after Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) left the door open while attempting to get a selfie inside the Giuliani tank."

And you get a fondling! And you get a fondling, too! Go  ahead, stick whatever body part you want under the seat, and you’ll get a  big fun surprise from the head of CPAC!” Whitaker added that one lucky  audience member would even get chosen to spend a few minutes alone with  Schlapp in his car."
188,"WASHINGTON—Expressing deep skepticism about the constitutionality of such executive actions, members of the Supreme Court’s conservative majority raised questions during oral arguments Tuesday about whether the president was legally allowed to improve the lives of Americans. “Our founders, in their abundant wisdom, saw fit to restrain the commander-in-chief from benefiting the American people in any discernible way,” said Chief Justice John G. Roberts, who joined the court’s five other Republican appointees in casting doubt on presidential efforts to even slightly lessen the burden of everyday citizens, let alone secure them some measure of peace or happiness. “Indeed, precedent suggests that our Constitution was drawn up with an eye toward maintaining the public’s general misery. Separation-of-powers principles clearly indicate that the president’s job is primarily focused on one duty: giving speeches that nobody watches or cares about.” Roberts expressed enthusiasm, however, for a related case suggesting that the chief executive’s duties could sometimes include compounding the average American’s suffering as much as humanly possible."

But don’t get used to this. And you have to promise me that no one’s going to wake up in the middle of the night and ask to come sleep with me again. If you’re a nation that’s grown up enough to stay up late, you can certainly sleep in your own beds.” At press time, Biden was heard screaming at the nation that it’s 10:15, that he doesn’t care what time Canada goes to bed, and that as long as they’re living in this country, he gets to make the rules."

Now, through a bipartisan effort to completely ignore calls to replace the Civil War-era braking systems on most of our great nation’s trains, we transformed this area seemingly overnight. You’ll notice I am tearing up, not only because the toxic fumes are now being violently blown in our direction, but because this is exactly why so many of us get into politics—to elicit tangible change that makes the lives of everyday Americans so much worse.”  At press time, DeWine announced he had now begin work on removing Ohio regulations surrounding organ donations so that residents’ now-infected body parts could be easily transplanted into healthy people to infect them as well."

We only have a campaign store to make the website look legit. Wait, they ordered a mug too? Who is this big weirdo? I guess we could screen-print it, but I don’t even know if I want their support.

I mean, on a given day, there are probably only a handful of people who notice me, and they’re all way too busy to bother scrutinizing my words and actions. Seriously, how many folks in this town even know my name?” At press time, sources confirmed that Biden had calmed his nerves before a major  summit on averting climate catastrophe by reminding himself that it was okay to make mistakes."
195,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to gain an edge over the crowded field to replace the outgoing lawmaker, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) reportedly sought Senator Dianne Feinstein’s campaign endorsement Tuesday by playing into the delusion that he’s her high school sweetheart who actually died in World War II. Multiple Capitol sources have reported seeing the California congressman in recent days sporting a wig and a World War II uniform while escorting the 89-year-old to a vintage jalopy, telling her that he’s back from the war, and taking her to the soda fountain. While all of the California Senate candidates have sought Feinstein’s endorsement, Schiff reportedly decided to capitalize on her declining mental faculties by adopting the identity of her high school sweetheart, Roger Larsen, whom she has apparently forgotten was killed in action during the 1945 Battle of Luzon. Sources confirmed that Schiff’s efforts began in the hours after Feinstein announced she would retire when her Senate term ended, and62-year-old Schiff entered her office in the guise of her 18-year-old high school sweetheart and told her that her parents had given him permission to take their lovely daughter Dianne Goldman for a drive. This effort seems to have been effective as an increasingly delusional Feinstein has been seen around Washington wearing a poodle skirt Schiff gave her along with his pin to symbolize his commitment, gazing dreamily at Schiff and telling him that, although she thinks he’s swell, she’s a good girl and wants to wait until marriage for her first time. Sources confirmed that Schiff has privately expressed his confidence that the Roger Larsen character can convince Feinstein to support his candidacy, as he has repeatedly told Feinstein that a brave soldier named Adam Schiff is the only reason he made it out of the Pacific Theater and back into Feinstein’s sweet, young embrace. At press time, however, Schiff’s efforts to exploit Feinstein’s disoriented fantasies were dealt a significant complication after fellow Senate candidate Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA) donned a string of pearls and a bouffant hairstyle to play into the delusion that she’s Feinstein’s mother, Betty Goldman, who died in 1983."

Seriously, he’s an astronaut, he has an identical twin brother who also went to space, and now he’s a senator? Frankly, in retrospect, the idea of Mark Kelly seems preposterous. It’s sad that so many were fooled for so long.” At press time, ActBlue was under fire after it was revealed the organization also made up Sen. John Ossoff (D-GA), Sen.

I just, like, formally preside, you know? No, I don’t break Senate ties anymore. I told you that.

Matt Gaetz (R-FL) to ask if she was “being weird” during the speech. “I just meant to call the president a liar. I didn’t mean to get into all that stuff about China, let alone go off on drugs at the border. What was I even talking about? It’s so embarrassing. Maybe I should call Biden and apologize for making the whole night so awkward?

I started losing steam there after the two-and-a-half-hour mark, but I got a second wind right after I looked Kirsten Gillibrand in the eye and said,‘You should be ashamed to be here.’ Finally, I went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and wagged one finger at myself.” At press time, Romney was seen stumbling around D.C. scolding national landmarks."

Ron DeSantis, teachers are being ordered to remove all books from libraries and classrooms until they can be approved by a state-trained “certified media specialist.” The following books are currently banned from schools in Florida. DeSantis has repeatedly criticized Dr. Seuss’ famous character the Grinch for not being overtly Jewish enough. According to DeSantis, this book promotes harmful socialist ideology by creating in children the expectation that everyone will, in fact, get dim sum. Wrongly encourages Black people to travel by car. DeSantis famously rejects Albert Camus’ existentialist embrace of the absurd and instead favors a more Sartrean realism, as explored in the governor favorite philosophical work,Being And Nothingness. Holden should’ve been meaner to the prostitute. DeSantis deemed the book’s depiction of Humbert Humbert to be disrespectful to the state’s many pedophiles. No characters named Ron. A gateway book that leads some Floridians to a lifetime love of reading. The removal of pornography from classrooms includes the obscene story of James and his presumably fat ass. Too scary. He feels threatened by Kristy’s work ethic. Children could be tempted by circles and their devious curves. Briefly mentions Robert Todd Lincoln had a buddy who was Black. He thought this one dragged in the middle. DeSantis banned this, in addition to several other pregnancy books, out of concern that learning about the process of childbirth would lead women to seek abortions. Shoves news literacy down children’s throats. The State of Florida bans all books that depict or even acknowledge the existence of Seattle.

Q: How do former officials end up with classified documents?A: There are actually trace amounts of classified documents everywhere, from the air we breathe to the water we drink. It’s all part of nature’s classified document cycle. Q: Why can’t presidents take classified documents home with them?A: The U.S. government encourages a healthy work-life balance. Q: Which politicians made harmless mistakes, and which ones actively endangered the safety of the country?A: The politicians you like made harmless mistakes, and the ones you don’t like actively endangered the safety of the country. Q: How can we prevent this from happening in the future?A: Unfortunately, there is no way to stop electing doddering old men to the nation’s highest offices. Q: Why was Pence holding on to classified material?A: An earnest attempt to keep male documents from sharing folders with female documents they’re not stapled to. Q: What should I do if I discover classified documents in my home?A: Make yourself as big as possible and back away slowly. Remember, they’re more afraid of you than you are of them. Q: Is there anything left in the National Archives?A: Just a few tank diagrams and Nancy Reagan’s beef casserole recipe. Q: What would happen if classified information is leaked?A: Journalists might actually have to report on the government’s efforts to undermine democratic decision-making, which would be really annoying for them. Q: Couldn’t this just be the FBI’s way of sneaking a peek into the homes of important people?A: It seems unlikely, but then again, who wouldn’t want to see what kind of fucked-up shit is in Mike Pence’s house? Q: What will be the ultimate outcome of these investigations?A: Will likely further delay the opening of the Barack Obama Presidential Classified Documents Library."

We don’t have a signed game ball for you, but we would like to present you with this Dick’s Sporting Goods gift card, which you can use at any location to purchase a regular basketball.” At press time, reports confirmed Harris had worn the wrinkled jersey around the West Wing for the rest of the day but no one commented on it or appeared even to notice."

While restrooms will not be provided, contestants may use the South Portico. And thank you to our sponsors at 103.5 KISS FM for helping to make this presidential election happen.” At press time, Trump was reportedly eliminated while trying to swat away a bee."
216,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that there was a “zero-percent chance” she had mishandled sensitive information, Vice President Kamala Harris assured the American public Friday that no one had given her a single classified document. “Not to look at, not even to hold—frankly, I couldn’t even tell you where they’re kept,” said Harris, who held a press conference to announce that even if she had had access to classified government documents, she wouldn’t dream in a million years of taking her work home with her, and that most of the binders in her office were empty anyway. “Please take comfort when I say I have no security clearance, on any level. My key fob doesn’t even work most days, and I have to text someone on my staff to come let me in. Yesterday, I stood outside the White House in the cold for 15 minutes before anyone came to get me.” At press time, Harris admitted that she had once taken home a roll of paper towels."
217,"After 15 votes and multiple days of negotiations, Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) finally won his bid to become speaker of the House.The Onionexamines what concessions McCarthy had to make. McCarthy agreed to be forcibly removed from office by the 15th of next month. Plus, Andy Biggs gets to do the stabbing. He just looks more like a “Steve.” It’s critical that representatives be given time to fake like they’re doing due diligence for their constituents. While not one of the formal concessions, McCarthy is free to pretend that this was part of the deal should any Democratic representatives see him eating alone. McCarthy had to make some tough concessions to hard-liners. Everyone in the GOP agreed it was this or nothing. Although the procedure is extremely controversial and incredibly painful, the Freedom Caucus made Kevin McCarthy agree to undergo foreskin surgery before they would cast their votes. “The Star-Spangled Banner” also needs to be sung constantly in four-part harmony, while at least one member of both parties performs an interpretive dance to “Proud To Be An American” on the House floor. This must continue without interruption for the next two years. Blink and the timer starts over. Opponents of McCarthy demanded he begin showing respect for authority by turning his backwards hat brim around to the front, despite the move putting his notoriously cool bad-boy attitude at risk. A hard decision, but McCarthy will still be able to see them every other weekend. Technically, all members of Congress were supposed to have this done as soon as they were sworn in, but it is a significant step nonetheless. Eye contact required. McCarthy must ride bitch in the backseat on any congressional excursions from the Capitol. McCarthy is allowed to accidentally kill one person by friendly fire each week, but if he does more than that, he will be replaced. In case McCarthy chooses to sleep around with anyone he wants as speaker of the House, he should be aware of the potential consequences. If passed, McCarthy may choose his method of suicide. Far-right Republicans claim they cannot govern unless they have high-definition security footage from every toilet in the Capitol. In case they do not agree with his governing style, the Freedom Caucus made Kevin McCarthy replace the speaker’s chair with an ejector seat that would launch him through the Capitol ceiling and over 50 feet into the air. The Freedom Caucus has been waiting for their turn with the Democrats’ kente cloth since Pelosi stepped down, and God only knows what they’re going to do with it now.

218,"WASHINGTON—Peeking around corners and ducking past doorways in an effort to get in and out of her workplace unseen, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly popped by the Eisenhower Executive Office Building late Wednesday to print out concert tickets. Upon confirming all members of her staff, who she had allegedly not seen in months, had left work for the day, Harris is said to have entered her office for the sole purpose of using a printer to access a pair of passes to that night’s Goo Goo Dolls show at the Merriweather Post pavilion in Columbia, MD. As a precaution in case she encountered her chief of staff or one of her aides, sources confirmed the vice president walked into the facility with her phone up to her ear, ready to engage in a phony conversation about how climate change was a “really tough issue” and to sigh loudly in order to sound very busy. According to reports, Harris then logged into Ticketmaster from her office computer, downloaded a file she renamed “border_security_ideas.pdf,” and printed the document with a nearby Epson EcoTank Pro ET-5850. After the vice president grabbed a granola bar from the kitchen and slipped out of the office mostly undetected, the Eisenhower building’s IT administrator was overheard giving Harris a hard time for using up all of the printer’s ink on her full-color personal holiday cards."

But you, well, pretty soon you’re going to be down there in the ground. So you can’t stay here. Are you still following me, Dianne? This office is mine.” At press time, sources confirmed Porter had been forced to wipe the board clean and start over by explaining that the Hart Senate Office Building was not Feinstein’s home and she did not live there."

What if conservatives want to hunt virtual easter eggs or attend a Roblox Twenty One Pilots concert? The leftists in charge of Roblox are trying to prevent conservatives from seeking the truth and learning what users are wearing, where they live, and if their parents are home.

Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) was elected speaker of the House early Saturday morning when the far-right GOP minority joined together with the rest of the far-right GOP majority. “It took a while, but we were finally able to get our 20 most right-wing members to compromise with our other 200 most right-wing members,” said Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), a McCarthy ally who was instrumental in helping the new speaker win over members of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus with key concessions to the majority GOP’s hard-right plans for this congressional term. “Electing Kevin showed that we’re able to smooth over the differences between the far-right faction and the other far-right faction to pursue our identical policy goals of eradicating the social safety net, punishing immigrants, and trying to subvert democratic elections, as well as find key compromises in the approach all of us will take to undermine a functional government. Whether you’re one of the holdouts who wants Republicans to pursue a radically conservative agenda, or one of the stalwart McCarthy backers who wants a reactionary right-wing agenda, you have a place in the McCarthy-led House. It’s a good sign for Americans that we’re able to compromise despite seeing eye to eye on every issue.” McCarthy allies also told reporters that the concessions allowed them to avoid the nightmare scenario of some of the far-right Republicans moving to align with the right-wing faction of the Democratic Party."

This has been the worst week of my life,” said the visibly frustrated California lawmaker, whose bid for the role of House speaker has been met with persistent opposition among members of his own party and has been the cause of severe anxiety that, McCarthy noted, was not being helped at all by the vengeful return of his urinary incontinence problem. “Man, I thought a dozen failed attempts for the speakership, our dog running away, and spilling coffee all over my desk yesterday were as bad as it could get, but now I’m peeing all over my sheets in the middle of the night. It’s like my freshman year of Congress all over again. Ugh, I just completely reek of piss. My wife and housekeeper can’t seem to look me in the eyes, and I could really use their support right now, because I’m sure not getting enough at work.” At press time, McCarthy was reportedly seen crying in the Capitol bathroom after Rep.

We’ve also received word from Capitol sources that this burst of productivity from our elected officials might not even be over—we could see an ninth, tenth, or even 11th vote today. This level of voting right out of the gate hasn’t been seen in America in over a century, and it bodes well for our nation’s future.” At press time, several new polls found that a majority of Americans supported giving the hardworking representatives a few days or even weeks off to rest."

I mean, certainly my record of damning my constituents to a life of unparalleled pain and suffering counts for something. Meanwhile, this infighting remains a useless distraction keeping us from slowly drawing our knives across the necks of ordinary Americans and letting the streams of gushing blood spill into our hands until a red tsunami washes away everything in a wave of ferocious splendor. Frankly, I cannot idly stand by as innocent people live to see another day. Can you?” At press time, Rep.

241,"LOS ANGELES—Pledging to never again lose focus on their most important constituents, the Democratic National Committee reportedly vowed Tuesday to make a better effort to reach out to the Hollywood elite. “What these elections have toldus loud and clear is that Democrats must get back to our roots as the party of Hollywood’s most influential celebrities,” said DNC chairman Jaime Harrison, stressing that Democratic candidates would pound the pavement in Beverly Hills, hand out flyers outside of Nobu Hollywood, and rub elbows with A-listers at Chateau Marmont fundraisers for as long as necessary to show that they hadn’t fallen out of touch with actors, directors, and producers. “Personally, I’ve spent hours listening to the concerns of people like Adam McKay to assure him that this party will never forget our country’s richest and most powerful creatives. We’ve let our attention stray for too long. That’s not who the Democratic Party is, that’s not who we ever have been. Simply put, we need to do better.” Harrison went on to emphasize that their renewed commitment to West Coast celebrities did not mean they would ever turn their back on New York City’s cosmopolitan elite."

I promise you, whatever porn I like on Sept. 11, I will attempt to hide the fact that I ever did it, denying it fervently and perhaps even blaming a junior staffer. But by then, several people will have already taken screenshots and shared it widely across the internet. You have my word.” Cruz went on to state that as with the last time he liked a porn post on Sept. 11, he planned to get off primarily on the public shaming, which he promised would cause him to ejaculate both forcefully and repeatedly."

No, it is  much, much worse. I have been a person of faith for 52 years on this  planet and every moment was a rotten lie. There’s no meaning in this  twisted universe. There is no God watching over us, and, surely, if there is any  sort of deity, he is a wicked being who tortures us for His pleasure.  Don’t call me reverend. I am not God’s emissary. I am His nemesis.” At  press time, Warnock’s approval rating had edged upward several points  after he was spotted tearing his clothes asunder and running naked into a  river to curse the sky."

Honestly, I almost felt bad for the guy. It took him 45 minutes just to call his militia and ask if he should kill the guy in front of me for supposedly committing voter fraud.” At press time, Jenkins told reporters that he was ultimately just grateful he made it to work on time, because as he was leaving, the elderly poll watcher saw a Black voter, clutched his chest, and collapsed."

At long last, this undemocratic holdover from the slavery era will be done away with, along with the rest of the U.S. election system. Obviously white is their No. 1, but they’ll rank the ones after that too. Kevin McCarthy reportedly plans to stand at the podium, launch himself into the air, and do a full backflip while Democrats watch. They don’t like her, but she has experience. The upside to having incredibly conservative fiscal policies is that there’s not much more they can do. You get it. Though largely symbolic, impeachment would send a strong message against theMonster-In-Lawstar. It won’t all be bad. The longstanding tradition of Friday crab boils will return to Congress. It’s starting to smell. On Hunter Biden subpoena day, Republicans reportedly plan to get matching tattoos that will feature the date of the subpoena as well as an intricate drawing of Hunter Biden’s face. The old one has been on the fritz ever since Lindsey Graham took it home for the weekend. Republicans will finally go through with overthrowing the government, but now that they are in power, it will be them who will be dragged into the streets. We’re not sure that we, as a nation, can handle this. Whispers are already brewing among Republicans who plan on using their majority to vote for a catering company to bring in lunch that will invariably give Democrats violent food poisoning. It’s fucking filthy. The GOP has rightly taken issue with the Biden administration killing foreign civilians in airstrikes and causing mass starvation in Afghanistan by freezing its government assets, not to mention the brutal sanctions on—wait, no, it will be over some Marjorie Taylor Greene bullshit. Many Republican incumbents and candidates have voiced their support for the actor Johnny Depp and hope that by controlling Congress they will finally have enough clout to inspire a chill hang with Depp. No more chic dinnerware and stylishly placed flower arrangements once tasteful government spending falls under the purview of the GOP-dominated Congress.

If there aren’t at least 10 in the subject line, who is even going to click? After losing everything to back McConnell’s 2020 challenger who never really had a shot, the last thing you want to see is another request for money. It takes a lot of time and effort to craft thoughtful responses. Americans would be far more likely to donate to Democrats if they promised most of it would go to Republicans. We would remember to donate if they asked more. Even if it does tug at your heartstrings, Democrats should think twice before sending you a photo of the beloved matriarch of your family in a hospital bed. This is not only ineffective but also tacky. Even though they always say it’s the last time, party leaders are always begging for more of your child’s freshly harvested adrenochrome. Though traditionally included in the first paragraph of all fundraising emails, many readers question whether this part is necessary.

With this program, they will be alone no more, as we will assign them a like-minded, unstable mentor, who can teach them to write manifestos, threaten their peers, and effectively carry out a mass shooting with one of the world’s most dangerous firearms.” At press time, after a flood of interest, Abbott announced that Texas had extended the assault rifle program to troubled children as young as 5 years old."

267,"WRIGHTSVILLE, GA—Pulling a kepi out from his jacket and flashing the cap for all to see as evidence of rank within the army, Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker claimed Thursday that he was an honorary Confederate soldier. “Although I may nothavefought directly in Gettysburg or Antietam, I am a 100% real officer in the Confederate States of America,” said Walker, who drew criticism for stating he was “suited up in my grays and ready to go to battle, sir” in response to a reporter who asked whether or not he would vote to raise the debt ceiling. “I spoke with Robert E. Lee personally, and he made me a firstlieutenant in the 63rdinfantry. My opponent wants to defund the Confederate army. Well, he’ll have to get through my regiment first. I have a sword,too.” At press time, Walker added states’ rights were the most important issue to him."
268,"The current GOP Senate candidate and former TV doctor has a long history of endorsing medical procedures that many have called “questionable” or “pseudoscience.” Here are the most controversial medical claims made by Dr. Mehmet Oz. Oz said he himself wore a bar of lavender soap on a chain around his neck to stop any bullet from penetrating his heart. Just because it works for him doesn’t mean it works for everyone. At this point, Dr. Oz was really just repeating things he heard on TV, like this iconic Red Bull slogan, and making serious medical claims about them. Any state-licensed physician like Oz should know that that round, juicy ass is absolutely perfect for those skintight pants. Ideally, according to Oz, the properties should be spread across at least four states with varying tax laws. While the Senate candidate might not publicly admit it, the human body grows hair in other places, too. Though not widely accepted in the medical community, this dangerous term has been adopted by his most loyal viewers. Everyone knows that the red Gatorade is the only one with healing powers. Longtime fans will never forget the episode in which Dr. Oz went on a 25-minute rant about how a body like that could never exist under God or science. When Dr. Oz invited Trump on his show in 2016, some were suspicious when he lauded the candidate’s trim, athletic build and his supposed ability to run a sub-four-minute mile. Oz has repeatedly claimed that the over 300 dogs he killed at Columbia University’s medical school were letting out yelps of sexual pleasure. Apparently they don’t teach all the bones at University Of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Oz has repeatedly and dangerously stated that the stomach and most of the GI tract should be replaced in the event of even a small tummy ache. Doubling down on his recommendations for midlife cancer screenings, the doctor claimed that the only true way to prevent colon cancer was to build colonoscopies into your daily routine. Oz’s revised food pyramid was declared “legitimately odd” by the FDA. Actually, more rigorous, long-term studies are needed to confirm that raw coffee extract can strengthen your skill in the exquisite art of the open hand. While not technically a medical claim, this statement is complete bullshit. He is a television personality."

It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been in the country, whether you have family members here, what your education status is, or even where you are—you are legally eligible to become deported in a matter of weeks. As an extra incentive, those who sign up for our legal deportation program in the next 90 days can ensure that they’ll have access to the next plane out of here.” Jean-Pierre concluded the press conference by introducing three migrants who were using the program to deport themselves, adding that deportation is what makes America great."

Let his decapitated head be placed upon a pike so that all ye who attend the farmers market held here every other Saturday remember what we do to wicked scofflaws in the state of Wisconsin.” After carrying out the execution, Johnson was reportedly informed by witnesses that the bread had come free with a meal the boy’s family had ordered at a nearby restaurant."

You were a shitty kid and are a shitty adult. You are nothing to me. You are less than nothing. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. If I ever see you again, I’ll kill you.

277,"WASHINGTON—Explaining why he and nearly every Republican in the House of Representatives had voted against a bill that would increase student access to counseling services, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated Wednesday that a lack of mental healthcare in schools was precisely what got him where he is today. “My political career is a great example of what a completely broken mental healthcare system can create, and every kid deserves that same opportunity,” said the eight-term representative, telling reporters his rise to the top GOP position in the House could be credited to a complete absence of any self-reflection, therapy, or personal growth during his adolescence. “When I was in school, there weren’t any supportive adults I could speak to about my problems, let alone anyone trained as a therapist, and that’s what allowed me to skate by without raising any red flags, eventually reaching the point at which I may very well become the next speaker of the House. Where would I be today if I had received the years of intensive psychiatric care I almost certainly needed? You can hardly expect to make it in Washington if you receive adequate treatment for your narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder.” At press time, McCarthy had introduced a bill to equip public schools with bigger cracks in the system for aspiring young sociopaths to slip through."

Even if you put a bill on the floor mandating that every American had to suck my dick and give me $200 after, I would still vote against it.” “I think counting numbers is a made-up crock of shit that liberals invented.” “For so many years, I’ve wanted to see my brother killed by lunatic extremists. This is still my best chance.” “Being president shouldn’t be as easy as convincing everyone to vote for you. You should also have to imprison hundreds of violent militiamen who swarm the Capitol to kill you.” “I think it’s a sort of meaningless piece of legislation that doesn’t really address the underlying issues surrounding election integrity. Also, it still allows Black people to vote.” “The less votes are counted, the better my chance to be elected to higher office.” “I don’t know. Why does anyone do anything? Get off my fucking back.” “Everyone else must suffer as much as I, a man whose name sounds like knockoff salad dressing.” “I really want MTG to start calling me Bud Light so that it will catch on with the others, so I vote for whatever she does.” “I don’t know. I just look at whichever way the person next to me is voting and vote the same.” “Gohmie naughty!” “I thought the idea of electoral count reform was cockamamy back when I voted against it in 1887, and I still think it’s nonsense now!” “Because if it all breaks right in 2024, guess who’s gonna be president? That’s right, Mark Amodei.” “If my 17-year-old girlfriend’s vote doesn’t count, neither should anyone else’s.” “I didn’t want it to go forward because I don’t think that a bill on voting rights should get decided by something as undemocratic as the Senate.” “Wait, they record how we vote? Fuck! My constituents are going to be pissed.” “If you’ve read the entire bill, you know that it contains a lot of words, which made me tired and bored, so I voted nay.” “I have a special coin I keep in my desk. It has Thomas Jefferson on it. Whenever I have to cast a vote on a bill, I flip the coin. Heads is yea; tails is nay. People think I’m super conservative, but I’m not. Every decision I make is based on the coin, including the decision to never walk again. I love my coin.” “I couldn’t make the last Capitol riot, but I’m really hoping I get an invite for the next one.” “There aren’t enough frustrating ambiguities and loopholes in the presidential certification process to begin with, so I will be introducing my own bill to add a few wrinkles.” “The founding fathers designed our voting system to be so incredibly flawed that it is easy to exploit and manipulate, and it is our duty to keep it that way.” “Oh, is that what I was voting on?”"
279,"LANCASTER,  PA—Responding to growing demands from critics that he address ongoing concerns about his health, U.S. Senate candidate John Fetterman reportedly offered  voters full medical transparency at a rally Wednesday by ripping his  heart out of his chest. “It’s essential that we address any worries  voters have about their candidate’s fitness for office, which is why the lieutenant governor chose to tear out his still-beating heart and hold  it out for all to see,” said campaign manager Brendan McPhillips, stressing that  it was an essential part of running an honest campaign for Fetterman to  hold the pulsating organ close enough to the audience that it  splattered their shocked faces. “Frankly, we wanted to head  off any of our opponent’s ginned-up rumors about John’s health, and we  absolutely think we did that when he gasped out, ‘See? Do you see how it  still beats?’ as he grew increasingly pale and weak from blood loss.

You guys remember me, JFK’s cousin who works with the secret cabal—does that sound right? What about UFOs? Do people like the UFOs?

I’ve claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen, ignoring the fact that I won reelection on the same ballot. I honestly don’t know what else I can do.

Then I should be able to calculate all possible arguments and counterarguments that, when viewed through the discursive model within which we’re operating, could posit effective strategies for connecting with voters.” Walker added that he hadn’t gone this deeply into these topics since he made a name for himself in the 1980s as a particle physicist at CERN."
291,"WASHINGTON—Detailing the features of his controversial new debt-relief program intended to violently massacre hardworking Americans, President Joe Biden unveiled Wednesday a new student loan forgiveness plan that will require many taxpayers to be dragged out into the street and killed like dogs. “To help alleviate the burden of outstanding federal loans, honest citizens will be snatched from their homes in the dead of night, forced down upon their knees, and shot execution-style while they scream for mercy,” said Biden, touting how the sweeping executive order will fulfill his campaign promise of making cities run red with the blood of responsible, debt-free people, who under the new policy will be spat upon and burned alive. “Those decent individuals who, through hard work and sacrifice, have already paid off their student loans will be targeted first, and any college-educated person earning more than $125,000 per year will be dumped in a mass grave after being skinned alive. Meanwhile, those who have unpaid student debt will be given $10,000 and an unlimited supply of grenades to toss into random houses in affluent areas.” According to reports, Biden ended the press conference by taking out a gun and shooting every member of the White House press corps who appeared old enough to have paid back their college loans."
292,"WASHINGTON—Slowly edging into a room filled with White House advisors and congressional leaders, Vice President Kamala Harris is said to have quietly stepped into the frame behind President Biden during his Wednesday announcement that the federal government would cancel up to $20,000 in student debt. Sources confirmed Harris took great efforts to ensure the Roosevelt Room’s door closed silently as she entered and sidled up several inches behind the president, looking toward the press with a triumphant smile just as the photographs began. The vice president then reportedly exchanged glances with a visibly confused Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, giving him a silent thumbs-up before crossing her arms and nodding seriously at the cameras. According to reports, Harris slowly retreated out of the frame after the final photograph was taken and left as silently as she came."

The Constitution clearly states that the South shall rise again.” “It would just be nice to have a civil war we could teach about and not bring up slavery.” “I recently killed someone, and if the war comes soon enough, I’m hoping it can just get lumped in.” “Um, something about George Soros and immigrants or—hold on, I have it written down somewhere.” “I feel like carnage on a national scale might shake things up a little.” “It’s either prepare for a civil war or try to get out there and date again.” “I’ve got some vacation days saved up.” “It’d help me get my steps in.” “If I’ve learned one thing from watching the modern Democratic Party operate, it’s that they’re an uncompromising faction working in perfect harmony, and they’ll do anything to accomplish their goals.” “Not really sure. I’ll probably just do it until the NFL regular season starts.” “Oh, this isn’t for a civil war. I’ve always had this many guns.” “Just because you fantasize over something so much it becomes your entire personality doesn’t mean you want it to happen.” “You can only bomb so many Middle Eastern countries before you eventually start bombing your own.” “When I was a child, the government forced me to learn to read, and I can’t unlearn that. That’s tyranny.” “If regular war is good for the economy, a civil war must be twice as good.” “I’m rock hard just thinking about the profit we’d make.” “My ratings have been way up. So that’s not a great sign.” “We need new statues.” “It’s just easier to go to war again than take down my Confederate flag.” “I really don’t see any solution to this other than us getting killed by the government.”"
294,"AUSTIN, TX—Calling it a “vital” first step toward regulating mass shootings, Texas lawmakers passed a new law Monday that requires gun buyers to show proof of mental illness. “Starting today, all prospective firearm owners must be evaluated by a state-licensed physician and be able to document that they currently suffer from violent tendencies or are otherwise mentally disturbed,” said Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, adding that registered gun owners would need to take yearly exams to confirm they routinely threaten people’s lives, fantasize about murder, and actively wish to do harm against others or themselves. “Henceforth, no individual without a history of psychopathy or violence against women, children, or marginalized groups will be allowed to purchase automatic or semiautomatic weapons. And if they do not have an unsecured, unlocked area to store their gun, they will not be granted a license.” At press time, Abbott added that the state had passed further regulations requiring that anyone who had been reported to be planning a mass shooting of any kind be given complimentary ammunition and firearms."

Their eyes widen. We run at each other. For hours, we make sweaty, steamy, passionate love, and then we collapse to the floor. They arrest me. We long for each other for months, until we lock eyes again in court. They shed a tear as I’m carted off to jail. Is that what you want? Is it?” “Who did what now? Sorry, I’m pretty burnt out, to be honest. No one tells you that being a pawn in an evil empire takes so much work.” “Thank God they did the raid. Trump took me from the White House and had me stashed in that safe for years.” “Damn it. And to imagine I was mere hours away from rolling out our new slogan, ‘Florida: The Only State Where the FBI Wouldn’t Dare Raid Your Home for Stolen Documents.’” “The FBI has strayed so far from the agency’s original mission to kill civil rights leaders.” “Oh, so let me guess—having a little classified White House information gets you canceled now?” “This is horrific, but unsurprising. Remember, Jesus had His Florida resort raided by the American government, too.” “I don’t understand. Dad said he sold Mar-a-Lago, and that’s why I couldn’t have my birthday party there.” “It’s appalling that the FBI is going after former president Donald Trump yet completely ignoring former president Hunter Biden.” “I am going to spank the FBI.” “If Trump can get investigated, then by that logic, that implies our country has laws and when those laws are broken, there are consequences. What kind of hell are we living in?” “Sure, the FBI raids Mar-a-Lago, but what about all the other issues that I say are more important in order to distract from the topic at hand?” “…and the primary function of law enforcement agencies isn’t to prevent or solve crime…it’s to maintain the status quo in order to protect the interests of the ruling oligarchy…” “Hoo doggy, imagine the shit they’d find in my house.” “This type of terrifying stuff only happens in brown people countries. But this is a white people country.” “This is not how the nation was taught to treat our elderly plutocrats.” “I am going to shoot the next law enforcement officer I see point-blank in the skull.”"
296,"PALM BEACH, FL—Clambering into the cardboard containers with delight the moment after agents had vacated the property, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. were reportedly thrilled Monday when  the FBI seized classified documents from Mar-a-Lago and left behind dozens of empty boxes for them to play in. “C’mon, Eric, get into that space rocket, and I’ll give you a ride to the moon,” said Don Jr., urging his brother to join him in placing one of the small boxes labeled “White House: 2019” onto his head, space helmets that would protect them as they blasted off into outer space. “Weeeee! Keep pushing, Eric. Phew, we made it! Okay, now we can build a moon castle way up here to live in. You be Mom and I’ll be Dad and we’ll build it so no one can ever hurt us—not even the Apartment of Justice.” At press time, sources confirmed the brothers had tuckered themselves out and fallen sound asleep next to each other in the same box."

If that was what clean energy feels like, I want it banned.” “I would save a lot on electricity if I didn’t have to keep the heat lamp plugged in on my lizard’s terrarium all day.” “Climate is all about perspective.

They’re pedos.” “My hairspray use alone has raised the temperature of the planet by 5 degrees. “Clean energy would mean that more minorities would survive, and that goes against my duty as an elected official.” “Say what you will, but a climate crisis makes it more likely that I die in a hurricane.” “I wake up every night to awful night terrors, tortured by the painful knowledge that I have no moral core and will vote along whatever party line serves me best, sacrificing society for my own personal gain, so I figure might as well lean into it.” “I refuse to turn America into some kind of clean-energy dystopia where we have breathable air and potable water and our nation’s oil lobbyists go hungry every single night.” “The devil takes many forms, and one of those forms is a wind turbine. Another form is a hydraulic dam. And another form is the solar panel that keeps telling me to kill my family.” “They wouldn’t try my idea for shrimp energy. It’s an alternative form of energy where you have shrimp run, or swim, or whatever, I haven’t totally ironed that part out yet, but then they make energy that is natural, like the good kind of energy, way better than wind energy, which frankly makes me frightened. I gave Congress all these diagrams, which I drew all by myself, of hundreds of happy shrimp jumping or rotating very quickly, and that creates tons of energy, like 100 energies per second, but noooo, the Democrats aren’t interested. Well, if you wanted to lose the Shelley Moore Capito vote, you done lost it!” “Don’t understand. Bill Democrat, Democrat bad? Republican good, Democrat bad? No Democrat, yes Republican.

298,"WASHINGTON—Assuring the public that he intended to make the diplomatic situation his top priority, President Biden told reporters Thursday that the United States would not rest until WNBA star Brittney Griner was returned home to serve a marijuana possession sentence. “Rest assured that we will keep our nose to the grindstone until we have word that Miss Griner is back on American soil and safely behind bars for breaking the law,” said Biden, who characterized the basketball star’s sentence of nine years in a Russian penal colony for 0.7 grams of cannabis oil as a “gross miscarriage of justice” when she should be incarcerated in a federal prison for the same thing right here in the United States. “This is an American citizen we’re talking about. She should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law in her own country for participating in the trade of illegal narcotics. Right here and now, I’m pledging to Miss Griner’s family: Brittney is coming back to America and then she’s going away for a very, very long time.” At press time, the Kremlin had reportedly indicated that they were open to a prisoner swap in which the U.S. returned a notable Russian dissidents  so that he could be placed in a Chechen concentration camp."
299,"TAIPEI—Explaining that the powerful display had left her feeling humbled and honored, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday she was moved by China’s  spectacular show of military force celebrating her visit to Asia. “Wow, I wasn’t sure how the Chinese government felt about this Taiwan trip, but throwing a whole military extravaganza in my honor makes me get the message loud and clear,”  said Pelosi, who reported being “delighted” and “really touched” when Chinese warships and helicopters appeared in full force to run military drills off the coast of Taiwan in the wake of her visit. “I know how expensive those ballistic missiles are, so I would’ve been happy with one or two. But launching 11 of them? That’s just spoiling me. Really, I  can’t thank China enough for this warm welcome.” At press time, Pelosi added that if this was the sort of hospitality she could expect from China, she would plan to come back to Taiwan next year, too."

Silk? Thanks. I’ve always been a sucker for stripes. And you know, while we’re at it, I want to work out of the Oval Office for a couple of months. I’d offer to let you use my Senate office, but I’m sure you can find another space. Oh, and I’m going to need your jacket, too. Why? Because I’m your God, that’s why. Did you just fucking flinch?” At press time, a nude Biden had announced he was making significant progress with the senator. "

Biden then  handed out  miniature candy bars to gathered reporters. “It’s nice to hang up a few skeletons on your porch and keep a little plastic pumpkin filled with treats on your counter, right? Now you’ll be able to do that every month, whether on the creepy-crawly New Year’s Eve Halloween or on the Halloween that comes right after Thanksgiving. Get ready for a lot more haunted houses and bobbing for apples, folks. I hope this is what everyone wanted. I’m trying here.” At press time, Biden’s approval rating had reportedly skyrocketed to 89%."

Q: Why is Pelosi traveling to Taiwan?A: Taiwan has always been on her bucket list of places she’s wanted to escalate foreign tensions. Q: Why is China against the trip?A: Chinese leaders are concerned about the negative impact of excessive air travel on the planet. Q: Why do the trip now?A: Words cannot describe the beauty of Taipei in August. Q: What does Pelosi hope to accomplish with her visit?A: Foster a better understanding of how her semiconductor stocks are performing. Q: How is China responding?A: With a total bloodbath of harsh rhetoric that the U.S. will never recover from. Q: Are the Chinese reading too much into U.S. policy?A: Yes, they need to understand that the majority of American lawmakers don’t even know what Taiwan is. Q: What is Pelosi’s message to the Taiwanese people?A: She sincerely hopes they vote Democrat in the midterms. Q: Will escalating tensions affect the Little League World Series team Taipei is sending to Williamsport this year?A: Lord, we hope not. Have you seen how well Liao Kuan-shu is pitching? Q: How has President Biden responded?A: Biden took serious issue with Pelosi’s plan to visit Taipei’s Ming Fu restaurant, which he has long maintained doesn’t deserve its Michelin star. Q: Does Taiwan even want Pelosi to come?A: Who gives a shit what Taiwan thinks? This is about us and China."
303,"TAIPEI—Responding to widespread condemnation of the trip from Chinese officials, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi issued an assurance Tuesday that her visit to Taiwan was simply part of a bachelorette party  she didn’t plan. “Believe me, I would have loved to stay in the States and do something simple like get a cabin in the Smoky Mountains, but  the other bridesmaids really thought  what Jenna would want  is a girl’s weekend in Taipei,” said Pelosi, who expressed  deep annoyance at the high cost of airfare and exhausting itinerary for the bachelorette trip and noted that she didn’t feel comfortable bringing up Taiwan’s status as a contested territory because she didn’t want to butt heads with the bride’s high school friends. “It was one of those stupid email chains with everyone randomly calling out different places, which we eventually whittled down to Nashville, Vegas, or this. But we ultimately  went with Taiwan because the maid of honor found a zip-lining Groupon in the area. Whatever. It is what it is.” At press time, Pelosi added that she was also not particularly happy about the betrothed couple’s destination wedding in Pyongyang."

I am also requesting an emergency 500,000 pounds of debris and rubble be airdropped throughout the affected areas. Congress must act to complete the destruction of these communities while we still can. Without this injection of supplemental floodwater, hundreds more Kentuckians could find themselves alive.” Asked what the American people could do to aid the flood victims, McConnell requested donations of rotten food, contaminated medications, and anything else that could help increase Kentuckians’ pain and suffering."

While the book won’t be released for nearly a year,The Onionwas able to secure an early draft. Here are the biggest revelations inManhood. His former classmates noticed his cowardice even back  then. Women are trying to destroy the beloved male traits of  violence and misogyny. The one quantifiable  measure of masculinity is how strongly you can resist passing gun  control reform in the face of weekly massacres of school children. The book centers on life in the slow country town of Hawley’s youth. “No one has done  more damage to American masculinity than Olaf,” Hawley writes. “He is  made of snow. He will never be a real man.” So don’t waste your time looking. Sexism, plain and dry. Explaining his  opposition to ObamaCare, Hawley argues testosterone is a natural remedy for  any ailment. Sprinkle salt around your bed at dusk to ward off these  harpies. Most of the  book is just the words “placeholder” and “Josh Hawley TK” repeated in  different fonts. The number of adverbs and  split infinitives that distract from any erotic content is one thing.  But phrases like “sweatily fumbling ball of limbs” are barely  comprehensible, let alone titillating. Does an endorsement  from the master of suspense really mean anything at this point? Several chapters are devoted  to penis size, penis length, penis girth, penis area, penis agility,  penis responsiveness, penis resilience, and penis decorum. He repeatedly  stresses that he is fine but not especially thrilled with representing  the mediocre people of Missouri. The Missouri senator goes on to argue that 7 is  “actually quite good” and “far above average for the typical U.S.  female.” Obviously not expecting anyone to make it  that far in the book, the last couple chapters are just rambling  observations about his favorite shapes and colors. Appropriate: A blonde bison, breasts  oozing apple pie filling, a nun in a cowboy hat. Inappropriate: Two  robots kissing. And he’s not going to, no matter how much his  wife begs because he’s the head of the household. If there’s any money left after that, he’s going to get  limb-lengthening surgery too. Chapter 12 details how  floored he remains that his Democratic colleagues are too cowardly to  hold him accountable for clearly seditious acts."
306,"TALLINN, ESTONIA—Submitting their candidacy for the rest of the world to consider, officials from Estoniareportedly announced their interest Tuesday in assuming America’s role as the global superpower. “It’s pretty clear that America really isn’t capable of being the planet’s hegemonic power any longer, so we thought, hey, why not Estonia?” said Estonia prime minister Kaja Kallas, adding that while the world’s 152nd-most-populous country that ranks 100th in GDP might not be the one that immediately springs to mind as best suited to shaping the global economic and political landscape into the future, Estonian officials felt like their country would do a good job. “For almost 100 years, the world as we know it has been dominated by a single superpower—America—that uses its financial and military might to impose its will on everyone else, so we’ve been slowly adding military capacity and making inroads into manipulating the global economic superstructure in order to show that we’ve got what it takes. We know it’s a lot of responsibility, what with toppling foreign governments and holding other countries hostage with sanctions and so forth, but we really feel like we’re up to the task. Obviously, there are other countries like China and India that seem interested as well, but we feel like Estonia is a nice non-controversial pick to control global fortunes and lead humanity into the, dare we say, Estonian Century? Now we’re just wondering who we speak to about this—do we ask the U.N.? We also have this idea for the E9, which is a group of nine global leaders run by Estonia. Anyway, it would be an honor to be considered, and honestly, if America can do it, it really can’t be that hard.” Estonian officials added that they would be happy to shadow America for a few months to gain some hands-on experience with being the global superpower while America continued to phase itself out of the role."

Feinstein—isn’t that right, Dianne?” said McConnell, nudging the 89-year-old Feinstein with his elbow until she repeated after him that California had never, ever been a blue state and that she remained proud to serve her constituents as a member of the GOP. “You and me, we’ve been voting pretty much the same way for decades, right? Right? Remember the crime bill in ’94? Dianne here started off as a Goldwater Republican, then steadily matured into an evangelical theocrat, and actually was among the first senators to endorse Donald Trump for president—or at least that’s what she told me earlier, didn’t you? That’s right, you did. I remember, because it was right after you told me how you voted Democrat once or twice in the ’60s but quickly corrected course in time to wholeheartedly support the Nixon administration. Anyway, looks like I’m in charge again.” At press time, McConnell was seen guiding a pen in Feinstein’s hand to sign a bill completely obliterating the right for women to vote."
308,"WASHINGTON—Countering the stalled PACT Act with a measure of their own, Senate Republicans unveiled a new bill Friday that would rapidly expand veterans’ access to burn pits. “We’ve heard your concerns, and we want to assure you the GOP is fighting hard to ensure the nation’s brave veterans are breathing the toxins they deserve,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who explained that the PITS Act, sponsored by himself along with Senators Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Joni Ernst (R-IA) in response to the backlash they received for their failure to back the prior bill, would ensure that a 10-acre burn pit was on-site at every VeteransAffairscenter in the country. “The Republican Party would never turn their backs on the brave men and women who served this country, which is why we’ll hopefully be rolling outburnpits.govvery, very soon. There is nothing more important than providing vets with asthma and COPD. We’d also like to build at-home burn pits for veterans who need rare cancer but have limited mobility.” At press time, Republicans had proposed an amendment that would put the veterans themselves directly in the pits."

They deserted us to go abroad, and expect nothing but accolades when they come crawling back. Pathetic.” “Don’t really see the point of veterans healthcare if we can just get new soldiers every year.” “I thanked them for their service. What the fuck more do they want?” “Where’s the heroism of going to war if you come home and suddenly your country provides you with a comprehensive safety net?” “I campaigned on a strong pro-burn pit platform.” “If these freeloading veterans really wanted healthcare, they’d come home and become senators.” “In my opinion, if you get your legs blown off by an IED, that’s your problem. Normal smart people don’t go around stepping on land mines.” “As one of the top recipients of Saudi money in the Senate, I’m not interested in any bill that doesn’t place Saudi veterans’ healthcare first.” “I really just wanted to feel something. Anything.” “I heard that the injuries they got in the burn pits means some of these veterans can’t even have children. I’m not sure why you’d help someone who can’t even have children.” “Veterans’ healthcare is completely unnecessary if they just died overseas like they were supposed to.” “I’m worried people would forget that I’m a piece of shit if I voted for it.” “It was an easy no on healthcare after I realized that the veterans would be too fucked up from the burn pits to come after me.” “Doing so would only support the very same socialist ideals that they fought so hard to prevent.” “Ensuring that our veterans suffer needlessly is absolutely essential to reminding any American thinking of rebelling against the current system that their lot in life could always get worse.” “If you’re joining the U.S. military, frankly you’re just asking to get burned in a burn pit. I’d like to see our veterans take some personal responsibility for your injuries for once.” “My father never gave me treatment for exposure to toxic materials growing up, and I turned out just fine.”"

This is payback, Mateo!” “It plays well in focus groups.” “If we allow same-sex marriage, what’s next? A tree that gets abortions? A Marxist camel from California that commits incest? A kind of pill that turns all semen into gay Barbies? Absolutely not.” “Children can’t get married anyway, so what’s the point?” “Marriage was only meant for heterosexual, abusive relationships.” “Marriage should be between a man and a woman who are disgusted by each other’s physical forms so much that they must force arousal on themselves every time they are required to procreate.” “Scripture teaches us that marriage should only be between a man and a woman and a woman and a woman and a woman.” “It has no place in a healthy, functioning theocracy.” “I think of penis all day and I think of how no penis should go near other penis.

If there are enough vested stock options to support continued investment in same-sex marriage, then it should be allowed. If there are same-sex derivatives that cannot mature due to market pressures, then it shouldn’t be allowed. So let’s be smart about this.” “If men can marry men, then what’s to stop me from finally pulling the trigger and marrying my incredibly sexually attractive dog?” “I believe that marriage is between one woman and one man, as clearly stated inThe Art Of The Deal.” “Before I started in Congress, I was a Christian pastor, which is to say I am a fucking idiot and bigot like all Christian pastors, since the Christian religion as an institution has ceased to have even a thread of connection to the actual teachings of Christ and is merely a way for assholes to launder their seething small-minded hatred of others into something that seems respectable, so that’s your answer right there.”"

313,"WASHINGTON—As evidence continues to emerge regarding the actions of U.S. lawmakers during the 2021 attack on the Capitol, the House Jan. 6 committee unveiled Friday new findings that confirm more than 200 members of Congress hooked up during the riot because they believed they were about to die. “With rioters occupying the Capitol and hellbent on violence, senators and representatives feared for their lives, and we now know that scores of them spent the riot seeking comfort in each other’s arms and experiencing sex one last time,” said committee chair Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS), who recounted his own panic-fueled sex with a  congresswoman he declined to name in the office where they were both hiding, and then showed a video of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) sprinting through the Capitol in an effort to find one last sexual partner before the rioters killed them all. “Testimony from those present during the attack, corroborated in some cases by photographic and video evidence, reveals that dozens of desperate lawmakers decided to consummate long-held infatuations with members of the opposite party, while others simply went at it with whichever congressperson was closest at hand. Some of the more conclusive evidence of this collective move into dread-fueled sexual promiscuity includes Sen. Joni Ernst (R-IA) shouting ‘If this is really the end, then fuck it, do what you want’; Rep. Tom O’Halleran (D-AZ) leading a group of representatives on a hunt for condoms; and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) shaking Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) to get a hold of himself before leading him into her office. The scale of the fear is evident in the fact that few of them took party, age, or even gender into account, so desperate were these members of Congress to experience one last moment of erotic bliss before the slaughter.” The committee then showed a previously unaired video of screaming throughout the halls of Congress slowly turning into lustful moans and sustained cries of pleasure."
314,"WASHINGTON—Calling the arrangement necessary to achieve long-term success in the volatile region, State Department officials announced Wednesday that they had managed to broker a key alliance in the failed Southwestern state of Texas by providing arms to local warlords. “The lack of stable institutions has left innocent Texans devastated by constant power outages, horrific maternal mortality rates, and skyrocketing illiteracy—we don’t agree with these warlords on everything, but strengthening their hold on the area through strategic weapons shipments is frankly our best shot at bringing Texas some semblance of functioning governance,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who noted that while the State Department’s new allies undeniably held backward attitudes toward women and extreme religious beliefs, such views were sadly too commonplace in that part of the world to be avoided. “You have to understand that Texas has long been a lawless, violent place, where corrupt local police force residents to fend for themselves while maintaining a facade of order through frequent, oftentimes arbitrary executions. Sending these warlords Stinger missiles and towed artillery systems will let them fill that power vacuum in the places where they aren’t the de facto authority already, and once they consolidate their rule, we can use our influence to promote peace, better educational opportunities, and, perhaps one day, democracy.” Insisting that the government’s interests in Texas were purely humanitarian, Blinken dismissed allegations that the U.S.was only intervening to secure the region’s vast fossil fuel deposits."
315,"WASHINGTON—In  an address detailing the commanderinchief’s health following a recent  Covid19 diagnosis, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told  reporters Thursday that President Biden remained energetic enough to  have his customary morning intercourse with the First Lady. “Despite  some mild symptoms from the coronavirus, the president is still vigorous  and more than able to carry out his duties of bringing both himself and  the first lady to a shuddering climax,” said Jean-Pierre in a statement  in which she reassured Americans that the president continued to make  love this morning with the virility and attention to Jill’s needs of a  man half his age. “Admittedly, his mild cough prevented him from  pursuing his most common course of orallypleasuring for the first lady.  However, any concerns we had about the president’s condition were  immediately dismissed early this morning when the staff heard the  sensual moans of both him and the first lady coming from inside the  Lincoln Bedroom. Let me put an end to any speculation here: President  Biden is clearly still in his sexual prime.” Jean-Pierre then confirmed  this particular sexual act consisted of 17total pumps and ended  at 8:03a.m.before concluding the press conference without questions."
316,"HAMDEN, CT—Showing an alarming level of doubt from within the president’s own party, a poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University found a majority of Democratic voters would prefer someone else inhabit Joe Biden’s body in the next presidential election. “Most Democrats surveyed would rather see a younger, more in-touch candidate occupying President Biden’s corporeal form in 2024,” said pollster Vanessa Hilkinger, confirming that nearly 64% of party members would be partial to a new standard-bearer who was willing to fight harder for progressive policies from within the incumbent’s re-electable physical exterior. “A significant number also said they might not vote at all in the general election unless they were presented with a more charismatic and energetic candidate able to seize control of Biden’s thoughts and actions to enact economic, environmental, and healthcare reforms. In addition, approximately half of Democratic voters expressed interest in seeing a younger woman or a person of color piloting Biden’s limbs and using his voice to speak their own words during the 2024 campaign.” According to the poll, most Democrats, when pressed, acknowledged that if the party failed to “put someone younger in there,” they would support the hollow, empty husk of Joe Biden running for president."
317,"WASHINGTON—Scrambling for how to respond to the incumbent potentially topping their ticket again, party operatives confided to reporters Monday that Democrats across the nation were extremely worried President Biden would be healthy enough to seek reelection in 2024. “Whether you’re talking to senior party leaders, state-level officials, grassroots organizers, or the voters themselves, you realize the one thing we all took comfort in was knowing the president would probably be dead by now,” said a longtime Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that while there were a few political analysts who predicted Biden would survive four years in office, even they assumed he would be far too incapacitated, both mentally and physically, to run for a second term. “At this point, we can’t rule out his 2024 candidacy, which is an absolutely terrifying prospect. The whole plan in 2020 was to take back the White House with Biden and then the next time around—after he had fallen and broken a hip or suffered a massive stroke or flatlined on live TV in the middle of a big speech—nominate someone Democrats actually like. But unfortunately, it’s looking more and more like the president will still be breathing and have the cognitive functioning needed to put his name on the ballot one more time. This is a complete disaster.” The source went on to state that several Cabinet-level officials were considering broaching the subject directly with the president to gauge his interest in passing away sooner rather than later."
318,"WASHINGTON—Worrying that a plummeting approval rating may be clouding the president’s judgment, White House aides reportedly expressed concern Thursday that low poll numbers could drive Joe Biden to do something drastically popular. “Frankly, we’re extremely worried that these low poll numbers could be leading the president to a dark place mentally, wherein passing legislation for issues supported by the vast number of Americans may begin to sound like a logical solution,” said Biden chief of staff Ron Klain, adding that the secret service has already been put on high alert to watch for any sudden moves the president may make to fulfill one of his campaign promises. “He’s experiencing a lot of panic and depression right now as these early 2024 surveys come in, which can make it easy for someone to get too inside their own head and start entertaining dangerous ideas like cancelling student debt or, god forbid, codifying abortion rights. I’ve instructed our team to check in on him regularly, just to make light small talk and remind him that this is all temporary, so there’s definitely no reason to act rashly and permanently enact any meaningful reform that can’t be undone when he’s feeling better. The president’s mental well-being is of our chief concern right now, and we are dedicated tomaking sure that doesn’t lead him down a slippery slope to passing any mental healthcare initiatives.” At press time, a tearful Biden had to be talked down from signing an executive order to exonerate anyone left in prison for marijuana."
319,"WASHINGTON—A new nationwide poll published Wednesday by the Pew Research Center reportedly found that the majority of American voters wish President Joe Biden was way older. “Our data revealed that an overwhelming number of participants want Joe Biden to be an inexplicably decrepit, shriveled husk who is so old that it’s impossible to fathom how he’s still alive,” said Pew Research pollster Zachary York, adding that the results showed that a staggering 98% of those surveyed want Joe Biden to be between 147 to 236 years old.“Most voters feel they’d like to see a version of the President who needs an emergency medical technician standing by at all times with a defibrillator to restart his constantly failing heart. The research also found that 87% of those polled would strongly prefer that when Joe Biden attempts to speak only ash emanates from his mouth and his jaw falls off and shatters on the floor.” At press time, York confirmed that the survey found that Biden’s approval rating would significantly improve if a strong wind caused him to crumble into dust."
320,"WASHINGTON—Exploring his options for responding to several crises mounting across the country, President Joe Biden  told reporters Tuesday that he was seriously considering the prospect of convening the first-ever meeting of his cabinet. “It’s a pretty drastic step, so you don’t want to do something like this unless you have a good reason, but I was thinking of inviting all the heads of the federal agencies down to the White House for a meeting to discuss where we’re headed as a country,” said Biden, adding that it would be nice to see Secretary of State Antony Blinken for the first time since his inauguration, and that it would be good for everyone to meet the secretary of health and human services, since he wasn’t sure who he or she was. “It’s been a while since I got elected, so I think it makes sense to do itnow. We could probably start off with some meet-and-greets so that everyone gets a chance to say a little bit about themselves and what they’d like to accomplish in a Biden administration. Maybe some of them even have thoughts on how things have been going so far, which I would certainly be interested in hearing. Ultimately, though, I don’t want to force people to sit in a room just to sit in a room, and if it doesn’t feel like we’re going to have a productive cabinet meeting, we can probably just give it a rain check and meet some other time.” Biden added that along with his first cabinet meeting, he had recently begun mulling overthe idea of calling a couple senators he hadn’t spoken to in a while to find out what was happening over in Congress."
321,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that he was no longer the nation’s head of state and that he believed it was important to establish appropriate boundaries, former President Barack Obama asked the United States of America to stop contacting him Wednesday. “Look, I’ve moved on with my life, and it’s time you moved on with yours,” said Obama, who later confided to reporters that he was doing his own thing now and felt happier since putting distance between himself and what he described as a toxic situation with a country whose attempts to reconnect with him were “just sad at this point.” “It’s been almost six years, and to be honest, I was pretty checked out by the end. I’m respectfully asking you to give me the same distance I’ve given you. While there are things I will always cherish about our time together, I don’t like hearing you say I was the best you’ve ever had. You need to learn how to figure things out on your own without me.” The 44th president then added that because he thought it was best America hear it from him first, he wanted the nation to know he had been spending more time with France."
322,"WASHINGTON—Condemning the cabinet member for being so inconsiderate, Department of Transportation sources confirmed Wednesday that Pete Buttigieg’s locomotive was always taking up two whole parking spots. “You get one reserved parking spot, not two; I don’t care how big your vehicle is,” said Regina Merrill, one of many DOT employees who told reporters that Buttigieg had a habit of parking the train engine he drove to work diagonally across spots. “I understand that locomotives are expensive vehicles, but if he’s worried about getting a ding, he should at least park at the back of the lot so the rest of us aren’t inconvenienced. Last week, I was stuck behind him for 20 minutes while he tried to back out of the parking lot.” At press time, a police boot had been placed on Buttigieg’s locomotive for several unpaid parking tickets."
323,"Many are concerned aboutJoe Biden’s physical and mental fitness to serve another presidentialterm.The Onionasked Americans if Biden should run again, and this is what they said. “He should. It’s in the American spirit to work until you die.” “Might as well. We still have so many leftover fake ballots from 2020.” “I guess that’s ultimately up to his caregiver.” “It honestly doesn’t matter any more. We’ll take it from here.” “No.” “He might as well, since he’s already in the voting system or whatever.” “There’s another election? Don’t these things ever stop?” “Besides his first term, I can’t think of a single reason why Biden shouldn’t run again.” “Only if he’s truly committed to no longer aging.” “I hope so. When he runs, it’s the only time he promises to do anything.” “I don’t think so. I’m the same age as Biden, and my mind just isn’t what it used to be.” “Yes, please!” “He should try to stay in the White House, because moving is a real pain in the ass.” “I mean, what are we even doing here if we’re not going for the oldest world leader record? We’re coming for you, Cameroonian president Paul Biya!” “Only if he promises right now to step down for health reasons in 2025.” “It does make my job easier when everything has to be mashed.” “Obviously, when things are going great, you really want to keep that momentum going.” “It’s time he steps aside and makes room for rising Democratic stars like Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer, and Nancy Pelosi.” “I want a more mature, experienced candidate. Someone who’s 150 years old.” “Well, he does have that incumbent advantage of being battered nonstop in the media.” “I’m technically not allowed to say this, but he isn’t even fit to be in office now.” “Hopefully, legislative maps have been gerrymandered enough to make whoever is running for president not matter.” “Sure! Why not? I’m not gonna vote either way.”"

Please RSVP.” “Release the kraken, Mark! I don’t know exactly what that means in this context but thought it sounded cool in the event that something goes terribly wrong and these messages are subpoenaed and subsequently made public.” “I have been a loyal Dominion customer for years, but if you do not admit to what you did in November, I will never, I repeat NEVER, buy another voting machine from you again.” “Mr. Fallon, you MUST block the certification of Joe Biden in your monologue tonight.

What if something could be done...” “You can’t pussy out now, Ashli. Everything is going to be fine.”"
325,"As the House committee on the Jan. 6 insurrection continues its public hearings, Republicans are scrambling to shift the blame away from themselves. Here are the biggest talking points the GOP is using to downplay the Capitol riots. Not like Congress was being ransacked all over the country. The politicians on the right truly believe the highly coordinated effort was just the classic case of 2,500 lone wolves with an agenda. Republicans want to remind you that these insurrectionists had no intention of harming Mike Pence and were simply looking for a hanger with which to air-dry their wet clothes. The mob made sure they stormed the Capitol only when destruction was specifically permitted. Just think of what the Capitol would’ve looked like if so-called rioters dropped a bomb as powerful as a million tons of TNT. They might actually have a point there. It’s not like they tried to stop a presidency people were excited about. Blaming the insurrection on a bunch of 13-year-olds visiting the monuments is a risky move the Republicans are willing to take. This is a pretty factually sound argument. This is immediately undermined by the Democrats’ complete inability to orchestrate anything. Many aren’t even able to stand on their own two feet. If it’s not on the calendar, it’s impossible to prove. Even all of the really, really old senators survived. CGI technology really is incredible. That neoclassical eyesore has been begging for vandalism for centuries. Makes a lot of sense when you look at it from their point of view. Democrats are willfully ignoring the real issue, which is that January has 30 days besides Jan. 6. Really, we should be grateful they pointed out some vulnerabilities in our system. In their defense, every building in this dumb city is made out of white stone. Whoops. Politicians usually just think this one. Succinct, but 100% to the point. It’s true, whatever is still to come will certainly be much worse and more worthy of criminal prosecution. Can’t argue with that!"
326,"WASHINGTON—In response to the continuing debate over the ethics of public demonstration, Rep. Lyle Goodrich (R-CA) told reporters Wednesday that he supports the right of protesters to assemble anywhere an SUV can plow through them. “Americans absolutely have the right to make their voices heard in public spaces where an SUV could easily gain speed and mow down a whole group,” said Goodrich, adding that being able to ram a full-size SUV into a crowd of demonstrators was a vital American tradition that he would stop at nothing to protect. “Freedom of assembly means that U.S. citizens have the right to have their arms, legs, and skulls pinned under the tires of a large pickup truck, or even a mid-size sedan. The founders are very clear on the right to assemble anywhere a 5,000-pound vehicle can take out a dozen in a single maniac burst, and the First Amendment protects your right to make your voice heard while shouting from the wheel well of an Escalade. Whether it’s a march, a gathering outside an official’s home, or a candlelight vigil, if you can drive an SUV into the crowd and run over a hundred people within seconds, I support it.” Goodrich added that he is also a staunch supporter of letting protesters demonstrate within the crosshairs of a law enforcement sniper’s gun."
327,"WASHINGTON—Outraged by reports of the family-friendly LGBTQ pride events, conservative pundits and lawmakers across the country warned Friday that watching drag queen performances could turn children into attention seekers. “Our impressionable young children are at risk of becoming brash, bold performers attempting to get cheers from everybody in the room,” said Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), who slammed the all-ages shows as “immoral” and “perverse,” stating that she was deeply disturbed that any parent would take a child under 18 to a place where adults stood on stages and wore sequined, eye-catching clothing. “It’s completely inappropriate to take a young child to a show where people are reveling in the limelight. These poor children will only be confused, asking themselves, ‘Wait, if I lip-sync, can I get people to look at me too?’ It’s bad enough that Britney Spears’ choreography is freely available on YouTube for kids to memorize.” At press time, Boebert was calling for a ban on dancing in the presence of minors."
328,"AUSTIN, TX—In an effort to address rising gun violence in the state, Texas legislators passed a new law Friday mandating that police wait 24 hours before engaging with active shooters. “Deciding whether or not to respond to an active shooting is an extremely serious decision for any police officer to make, and we want to ensure that all Texas law enforcement officers have ample time to think it through,” said Gov. Greg Abbott, who added that the 24-hour waiting period, which would begin the moment dispatchers received their first 911 call, would help police be “100% certain” that protecting the public was prudent. “Before rushing into a school or church to stop a massacre, police will be required to wait a full 24 hours, never acting a minute sooner. They’ll also be subject to mandatory counseling with their peers in the parking lot so they can fully recognize the risks involved with attempting to save lives. We wouldn’t want them to do something in the heat of the moment that they’d regret, like taking out the shooter.” At press time, Abbott added that each additional 911 call authorities received would restart the waiting period."
329,"ALMEDA, PA—Taking a moment of silence to honor the teachers and students who will soon lose their lives, President Joe Biden reportedly visited the Almeda Middle School Wednesday ahead of its deadly mass shooting. “Two weeks from today is going to be a really difficult day,” said Biden, shaking hands with a sixth-grade history teacher who he praised for her upcoming sacrifice to save several students’ lives. “Walking through this hallway that will be riddled with bullet holes very soon, my heart goes out to all the families whose children won’t come home that day. We won’t understand why the young man will have done what he’s going to do, but we’ll take courage in the knowledge that we’ll have to act to stop something like what’s going to happen in this very school from happening in other schools. We as a country mourn for those innocent people who will be lost, and we wish there were some way to keep this horrific event from happening.” At press time, Biden was telling the school’s principal to save a candle for him to light at the upcoming vigil."
330,"HARRISBURG, PA—Touting the pill as a “miracle drug” at rallies and in his campaign literature, U.S. Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz reportedly began selling garcinia cambogia pills Monday that he said were guaranteed to lower taxes. “Folks, dropping those unwanted, stubbornly high tax rates is easier than ever with a supplement that experts are calling ‘the most exciting breakthrough in tax reform available today,’” the celebrity heart surgeon and office-seeker said during a campaign rally, offering Pennsylvania voters a discount on the “revolutionary tax buster” if they went to his campaign site in the next hour and entered the code “OZ2022” at checkout. “How does it work? Easy, the hydroxycitric acid extracted from this tropical fruit helps curb federal income taxes before their enacted, while simultaneously allowing you to double—even triple—your deductions. What’s more, garcinia cambogia actively boosts your refunds as you go about your day. If you started taking these 1,400 milligram capsules right now, you could be in a completely different tax bracket by the end of next week! Who wants a demonstration?” Later in the rally, Oz introduced a supporter who gave a testimonial about how daily doses of colloidal silver had helped her eliminate “critical race theory” from her child’s school."

Eating shit food in a disgusting, run-down diner? Talking about ‘our community’ with some old guys at a barber shop?

337,"SAGINAW, MI—Gesturing grandly toward the dust-covered assembly line as he declared that nothing, absolutely nothing, could stop the nation from crumbling, President Joe Biden touted the resiliency of American decline Tuesday while touring a factory that had been closed for decades. “As I stand here in this shuttered auto factory where 2,000 workers lost their jobs in the mid-’90s so General Motors could save money by outsourcing their positions overseas, I am reminded that no matter what happens, the United States will always foster the conditions for its own demise,” the president said during the 90-minute tour of the crumbling, derelict factory, adding that the shuttered plant was a perfect example of the kind of local political and economic crises that were destroying the nation one community at a time. “This abandoned factory is a perfect symbol for a nation that will stop at nothing to drive itself into ruin. For years after this factory was closed down, the community tried to restore its operation and bring back jobs, but every time, a strong, unshakable coalition of business interests and politicians banded together and refused to let it happen. America’s commitment to its diminishing power is truly something to behold, and at the end of the day, I hope that we as Americans can stand tall and be proud of our entropy.” Before departing the facility, Biden reportedly addressed the corpse of a heroin addict who had taken up residence in the factory and overdosed on the floor, calling the dead man a shining example of the nation’s beautiful spiral into chaos and suffering."

Roy Blunt (R-MO), who confirmed that the suspect, a middle-aged man brandishing a large manila folder, was tackled by Capitol police officers after walking onto the Senate floor and announcing he was armed with a proposal. “It was horrifying.

339,"WASHINGTON—In a shocking revelation that alleged the party would receive money in exchange for taking a dive, a bombshell report released Tuesday by the Brookings Institution found that Democrats were conspiring with their bookie to deliberately throw the 2022 midterms. “The evidence appears increasingly clear that the Democratic Party has been working with a Las Vegas bookmaker to profit handsomely from its efforts to intentionally lose as many of this November’s elections as possible,” the nonpartisan think tank’s report read in part, going on to state that the party’s public infighting and inability to pass substantive and popular reforms stemmed in actuality from their intention to rake in a huge cash windfall when the election doesn’t go their way. “Not only did the Democrats cut a deal with their bookie to get a big piece of the action when they lose the House, but the payout appears to more than double if and when they lose the Senate majority. This plan appears to have been in the works for the past two years, with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) agreeing to be the fall guy.” According to the report, the arrangement with the bookie also included an unspoken understanding that if the Democrats still  retained control of Congress after the midterms, their party leaders would be “fish food.”"

We will welcome Ukrainians escaping the violence with the warm bed just vacated by some Hispanic guy we captured and sent back to Mexico.

370,"Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement on Wednesday, leading to a flurry of speculation over who President Joe Biden will nominate to replace him. The Onion looks at the leading potential replacements for Justice Breyer. Anita Earls:Appointing a Black woman who will be constantly overruled by white people would make the court more representative of America. Jimmy Carter:Putting the 97-year-old former president on the court would ensure it has a strong new liberal voice for weeks to come. Ketanji Brown Jackson:The accomplished D.C. Circuit judge has everything Democrats could want for attorney general in 2027. Amal Clooney:Licensed to practice law in the U.S. and the U.K., Clooney could bring an international point of view as well as some much-needed star power to the bench. Jay Inslee:Sure, he’s not Black, and he’s not a woman, but apart from that, nominating him would be a perfect way to fulfill Biden’s pledge to put a Black woman on the Supreme Court. Kamala Harris:Would give the current VP an avenue to become unpopular in a third branch of government. Michelle Childs:For a court often considered too elite, Childs’ public school and non–Ivy League education could actually give her an advantage for the first time in her life. Barry Bonds:We’ll be damned if Bonds is going to be overlooked for the Hall of Fame and the Supreme Court in the same month. Ruth Bader Ginsberg:It’s not like she can die again."
371,"WASHINGTON—In a closed-door meeting to discuss strategies to fill the recentlyvacated court seat, President Biden reportedly met with Senate DemocratsThursday to discuss breaking up his Supreme Court nominee and confirming her in parts. “Many moderate members of the caucus fear that we’re inviting backlash by trying to push through the entire justice’s body at once, and we’d be far better served with a piecemeal method of getting her limbs and vital organs onto the court one by one,” said a moderate senator familiar with the discussions, adding that given the procedural hurdles in their way, the best chance Democrats had at filling Justice Breyer’s former seat involved voting for one of the justice’s shoulders and then perhaps a lung or two. “We already have a lot of agreement within the caucus that one of her hands would logically be approved immediately—so that it can hold a gavel, obviously. Moving on from there, getting to her torso would be a cherry on top. If we’re ambitious, we might actually getthrough her entire circulatory system. That’d be a huge win for progressives and moderates alike. But let’s cross that bridge when we get to it.” Senate moderates also pointed out the precedent of Republicans putting Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s floating head onto the Supreme Court in 1981."

Being able to maximize the rate of return on my holdings is core to the American promise, and this bill delivers on that promise.” A press release issued by Pelosi’s office touted more than 30 of the speaker’s stock positions that would be lifted out of the red if the legislation were adopted."
375,"ASBURY PARK, NJ—In the latest indicator of the commander in chief’s waning popularity, a new Rasmussen poll released Monday showed that the average U.S. horse still overwhelmingly preferred a carrot to a photo of President Joe Biden. “A staggering 98 percent of American horses responded more enthusiastically to the carrot than it did to an 4-by-6 glossy of Biden,” said poll analyst Morgan Fellers, noting that within that group, almost half of the participants went so far as to huff and stomp their feet when the carrot was taken away and replaced with the two-dimensional rendering of the president. “According to these results, one in 25 U.S. horses became spooked by the very mention of Biden and ran stampeding out of their stables—that alone should set off alarm bells throughout the DNC. It’s also important to note that the president will not be able to coast on the popularity of his running mate, either, should he mount a reelection campaign: More than 60 percent of horses completely rebuffed a photo of Kamala Harris when presented with an apple core.” At press time, Biden’s favorability had reportedly skyrocketed after pollsters began burying his photo in a stack of sugar cubes."

Hang Mike Pence!” along with him. “What can we learn from the events of Jan. 6? The enduring lesson here is that we must drag Mike Pence from his home and string him up from the rafters for all to see. Where was he when his president needed him most? Where was he when the true patriots needed his help to stop the steal? The only way to heal this divided nation is to unite around the shared cause of killing Mike Pence for his many failures as vice president. God bless this country, and God bless you all.” Biden was then seen departing the Capitol with a pistol, vowing to take revenge on Mike Pence himself."

379,"WASHINGTON—In what both ordinary citizens and experts agreed was a threat to the nation’s political system, American democracy  reportedly came under siege Thursday after a tech lobbyist invited some senators to dinner. “Rarely do we see such a brazen attack on our democratic values, and yet we could only watch in  shock and horror as a paid representative for several biotech firms entered Charlie Palmer Steak with three U.S. senators for a sumptuous five-course meal,” said political scientist Monica Turley, adding that the vicious assault on representative self-government was compounded by the fact that U.S. intelligence officials had done nothing to address it, despite records showing that the dinner reservation had been in place for months. “Only in a country where democracy is in  real danger could we see the lobbyist for a private interest discussing wine pairings with sitting members of Congress. What’s even more frightening is how shameless this attempt on our democracy was: Any passerby could have seen these individuals openly plotting how they would split up the seared foie gras and heirloom tomato salad. Ultimately, we may look back at the dinner of Jan. 6, 2022, as the beginning of the complete breakdown of the contract between the government and its people.” Political experts were at a loss for how to address this blatant threat to democracy, adding that virtually no one in any U.S. government institution seemed capable of doing anything to prevent the group from ordering dessert."
380,"WASHINGTON—Denouncing the Biden administration’s plan to replace every lead pipe in the nation’s water systems, critics warned Thursday that such an initiative would put millions of potential murder weapons into circulation across American cities. “The president is proposing a dangerous new government program that would place deadly weapons in the hands of violent criminals,” said Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), adding that while the reduction of drinking water toxicity was a noble goal on paper, once the estimated 6 to 10 million pipes were no longer in use as mains and service lines, the increased availability of metal bludgeons would push homicide rates to record highs.  “It’s completely reckless and irresponsible to be giving out free murder weapons in the name of environmental safety. What good is safe drinking water if American families can’t walk down the street without getting their heads bashed in by a pipe-wielding thug? Lead pipes must remain safely below the ground.” Cotton later clarified that he still supported the constitutional right of law-abiding citizens to carry lead pipes in public and beat people to death in self-defense."

They’ll give the Black children the melody and stick the white children with the harmony.

Oh, that’s good—I’ll put that I ‘used my organizational and problem-solving skills to help others facilitate the achievement of key objectives.’ That could mean anything.

Telling you that you have the right to vote without putting anyone worth voting for out there is pretty damn insidious. Many people can’t make it to their polling place until weeks after the election, making the decision to shut them down after a winner has been determined incredibly unfair.

While politicians may claim that the local school gymnasium is the perfect venue to hear a live rendition of “Sunday Bloody Sunday” in an intimate setting, voters should be skeptical they couldn’t have scheduled for a different night. Wow, that was amazing, but wait, can we get our ballot back? This cunning strategy has ratfucked the electoral system for the past couple hundred years. Sorry, did you say “Novlember Flourth”?

John F. Kennedy / Lyndon B. Johnson:Though publicly cordial, Johnson was humiliated by JFK’s frequent taunts that he didn’t have the guts to arrange the assassination of a president in his home state and be sworn into office by a family friend in a hurried transfer of power. Ronald Reagan / George H.W. Bush:Frequently got into heated debates over who harbored more contempt for the nation’s poor. Bill Clinton / Al Gore:A simple disagreement about the function of White House interns got between these once close friends. Dwight D. Eisenhower / Richard M. Nixon:The relationship was strained from the beginning when Nixon began talking about all the crimes he’d accomplish if he were president. Dick Cheney / George W. Bush:It was an open secret that President Cheney had little respect for his running mate. Millard Fillmore: The thirteenth president didn’t have a VP but makes the list because he was racked with self-hatred. James Polk / George Dallas:Polk was the messy one and Dallas was the neat freak.

394,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that he already had his turn in the seat of power, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) announced Monday that he would not be seeking re-election in order to make room for the next generation of 70-year-olds entering politics. “It’s time we let some fresh, septuagenarian blood into this place,” said Leahy in a press conference, explaining how this new wave of politicians is better equipped to deal with the pressing issues facing the nation, such as the Vietnam War and stagflation. “Although it fills me with sadness to leave a post I’ve held for nearly 50 years, these fresh-faced go-getters can more effectively address the needs of their constituents given that their hearing isn’t totally shot. The future is now in the hands of those who can still climb the stairs of the capitol without assistance and remember what bills they’re voting on that day.” At press time, critics were questioning whether a politician born in the 1940s has enough experience to deal with the contingencies of the job."
395,"MENDHAM, NJ—Saying he was fired up and excited for the chance to debase himself on a bigger stage than ever, former New Jersey governor Chris Christie told reporters Monday that he was ready for the next chapter of his humiliation. “Look, I’ve been out of the limelight for a few months, but I promise you that I’m in a place where I can finally turn the page and disgrace myself anew,” said Christie, explaining that despite his many ups and downs, he had no doubt that the greatest embarrassments still lay before him. “Really, I just want to do as much as possible to bring shame upon myself and my family. That’s what my time in office has always been about. So, yeah, I’m revitalized and can’t wait to embark on what just might be the biggest indignity of my life.” The former presidential candidate added that if his political trajectory had revealed anything, it was that you should never count out Chris Christie’s ability to disgrace himself and everyone affiliated with him."
396,"WASHINGTON—Unsettled by the party’s dismal performance in the Virginia governor’s race, Democratic leadership vowed Wednesday to work twice as hard in the coming months to muddle their agenda. “Last night was a wake-up call that we need to refocus our efforts on alienating the American voter with  vague goals and incomprehensible messaging,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, advising Democrats from Congress on down  to commit themselves to a party-wide effort to baffle new voters with confusing language and a borderline inscrutable agenda. “Make no mistake, we heard Virginians  loud and clear about what we need to deliver. So if there’s a popular section in our legislation, we will cut it. If any of our candidates attract a genuine following, we will work to marginalize them. And if we somehow manage to do something people  actually like, we will make sure it’s so buried beneath an avalanche of easily avoidable fuck-ups that no one ever hears about it.    Simply put, Democrats need to get out there and make it clear  that we can’t find our own ass with our hands.” Schumer went on to say that it would be extremely difficult to sell a more muddled message than “Build Back Better,” but  that this has always been where the Democratic Party shines."
397,"WASHINGTON—At last striking a compromise that unites all 50 Democrats in the Senate, the White House announced Wednesday that it had enough votes to pass a streamlined version of President Joe Biden’s social spending bill that had been stripped of every provision except for a $10 billion check for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV). “While we didn’t get everything we wanted, the important thing is that we reached an agreement that represents this country’s largest-ever public investment in Joe Manchin,” said Biden, noting that he ran for president as a consensus candidate and that the revised legislation—which removes broadly popular sections of the bill including a clean energy program,  paid family leave, and a tax on billionaires’ assets—apparently reflected Senate consensus. “This is how you get things done in a democracy. These funds will go out immediately and provide assistance to a lawmaker who is currently struggling in West Virginia and will now, thanks to our efforts over these many months, see his net worth increase many, many times over. We still have more work to do, but this is an important first step.” Administration officials added that they still believe Senate Democrats can use the budget reconciliation process to push through an additional measure addressing “whatever the hell it is” that Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) wants."
398,"WASHINGTON—Sighing heavily as he sealed himself inside the meandering political boundary, despondent congressman Rep. Dan Bishop (R-NC) reportedly gerrymandered himself into his own isolated district Wednesday, sources confirmed. “I’m fine, I just need to govern myself for a while,” said the Republican lawmaker from the ninth district of North Carolina, breaking the news to his constituents that he would no longer be representing them, or anyone for that matter, as he dejectedly sectioned himself off into what he morosely deemed the “Loneliest District.” “This way I won’t be letting the good people of North Carolina down, since I’m always disappointing them anyway. In fact, I’m probably better off consolidating power all by my lonesome. Not like anyone cares.” At press time, Bishop had reportedly replied to a voting rights  group’s concerns by insisting that he simply wanted to be left alone."
399,"WASHINGTON—Her face illuminated by the glow of a television, White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who tested positive for Covid-19 over the weekend, was reportedly sick and working from home Monday when she conducted a remote briefing while under a blanket and watchingThe Price Is Right. “Today, President Biden will be addressing world leaders in Glasgow to call for immediate action to—no, you idiot, what washing machine is $3,000?!” said Psaki, who near the end of the briefing experienced a mild coughing fit, took a sip from a thermos, and warned reporters that she would only have time for two more questions before the program returned from a commercial break for the Showcase Showdown. “Uh, anyway, negotiations continue as the president works to finalize details of his infrastructure plan, and the nine goes at the end! Put the nine at the end! Ugh. Moron. Excuse me, I’ll be right back. I just need to reheat this soup.” Psaki added that the Biden administration was working to address the global supply-chain issues that, as far as she could tell, had dramatically increased the actual retail prices of dinette tables, riding lawn mowers, and three-piece matching luggage sets."
400,"WASHINGTON—Appointing her to lead what they described as an absolutely essential initiative, top White House officials reportedly selected Vice President Kamala Harris to sit at a computer throughout regular working hours Friday in case any new emails came through. “This is a really important job, Madam Vice President, and we can’t entrust it to just anyone,” said White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain, explaining to Harris that she was needed to head up the new Presidential Email Task Force, which, though it would not have access to President Biden’s account for security reasons, would be tasked with monitoring kharris@whitehouse.gov. “We need your eyes on that inbox. It should refresh automatically, but if it goes a long time without a new message coming in, you may want to manually reload the page, just to make sure. That will be your call. We’re counting on you, Kamala. This assignment could very well determine your legacy as vice president.” Klain went on to tell Harris that if she received a pressing email or one that required a response, it must immediately be forwarded to more senior officials for review."
401,"WASHINGTON—With 80% of the nation’s daycares understaffed and many facilities shutting down, Congress responded to the child care crisis Friday by passing legislation that would lift restrictions on leaving children in a locked car for eight consecutive hours a day. “We need to get more parents back into the workforce, and so I’m proud to support this cost-effective solution that will drastically reduce reliance on expensive, hard-to-find child care,” said Rep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), who explained that the new plan would increase employment options for parents by eliminating the charges of criminal negligence they would previously have faced for shutting their kids in a car and leaving them in a parking lot for an entire workday. “This bill offers immediately assistance to that mom or dad who is struggling to make ends meet but, because they are needed at home, are hesitant to take on that second or third job. The new program is totally free and provides parents with the peace of mind that comes from knowing exactly where their children are at all times. It come with built-in safety features, too: Parents can lock the doors to their vehicle, and if a child is in danger—well, I bet your kids already know how to honk the horn, don’t they?” Recognizing that not all families have a car, lawmakers passed an amendment allowing parents to leave their children in a bus shelter or on a train platform for the duration of their shift."

It’s time to live up to this country’s ideals. It’s time for a breakthrough.” At press time, Yang had announced immediate plans to sever ties with the Breakthrough Party and form a fifth unnamed party that would help cut through the noise of U.S. politics."
403,"WASHINGTON—Hailing it as a historic agreement and a culmination of President Biden’s domestic agenda, congressional Democrats successfully reached a deal Thursday to introduce a landmark fundraising email. “We couldn’t be more thrilled to put forward this extensive, once-in-a-generation communique,which is the first of its kind to include distribution lists from all sitting Democrats in Congress,” said House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, confirming that after weeks of negotiating, the proposed email appealed to moderates with a lower price tag than a proposed mailer or TV ad spot, while also including language about the existential threat of climate change in order to appease progressives. “We’re still hammering out a few of the final details about whether to ask for donations of $10, $15, or $20, but our priority is getting this out the door as quickly as possible and into the inbox of hardworking, everyday Americans where it can make a difference.” At press time, the fundraising email had faltered after Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) expressed serious concerns about the subject line."
404,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that literally any occurrence in the coming year might threaten the party’s fragile hold on power, political experts warned Wednesday that everything that will happen between now and November 2022 could spell trouble for Democrats in the midterms. “Unfortunately for Democrats, anything that occurs in the next 12months—really anything at all—could be a portent of a midterm upset,” said political analyst Gary Chiang, describing how every coming event that transpires before the election could have serious repercussions for the Democratic Party, including passing climate change legislation, not passing climate change legislation, a proxy war in Asia, Nancy Pelosi sitting down in a chair, the death of giant panda Mei Xiang, winning down-ballot races, the complete implementation of the Build Back Better agenda, or a shortage of turkey around Thanksgiving. “An oil spill in the Gulf Coast? That’s a worrying sign for Democrats. On the other hand, a cloudy day in Washington in January? That could also prove disastrous come November. Reallyanything that happens in America or abroad from here on out might destroy the party’s chances to retain their congressional majority.” Chiang added that the only event that would not spell doom for Democrats would be for the White House to announce a full-scale ground invasion of Afghanistan."
405,"WASHINGTON—In their latest effort to bring the centrist lawmaker aboard for the party’s signature legislation, Democrats reportedly attempted to woo Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) Monday by taping a single Hershey’s Kiss to the reconciliation bill’s latest draft. “Although we understand Joe won’t budge on certain issues, we thought a sweet little treat might be just the thing to help move the needle,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) of the foil-wrapped chocolate candy, which the majority leader had taped to the 329th page of the $2 trillion bill’s provision for a Child Tax Credit next to a smiley face and the words “For You, Joe!” “Frankly, anything that helps inch us closer to a Clean Energy Standard is worth trying, and if that means sweetening the pot with a tasty morsel to brighten up Senator Manchin’s day, then so be it. Just making him smile is worth the effort, either way.” At press time, Schumer added that should Manchin find the confection to his liking, there could be several more Hershey’s Kisses coming his way."
406,"LINCOLN, NE—In an effort to reach those 18 and younger who had turned to a dangerous false god lurking in the fields, Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R)announced a program Monday aimed at lifting children out of the cycle of violence they fall into when they join corn cults. “It is imperative that we provide deprogramming services to the young, impressionable Nebraskans who have been lured into the cornfield by a demon,” said Ricketts, referring to the mysterious deity who reportedly orders children around the state to murder and dismember local adults, the human sacrifices perhaps serving to replenish the soil with the souls of the righteous. “With community outreach and after-school programs, we believe we can reach the 37% of our children who, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics, have drunk the blood of their peers after using corncob knives to cut pentagrams into their bodies. Unfortunately, this is a generational problem in which these kids don’t have any responsible adult role models to look up to, usually because their parents and all the grown-ups they know have been butchered or poisoned by the corn cult.” At press time, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack spoke out against the Nebraska program, citing the benefits of his own lifelong worship of He Who Walks Behind the Rows."
407,"WASHINGTON—Paving the way for the committee to seek criminal charges against the political advisor, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon defied a subpoena from the January 6 Select Committee on the grounds that he would be digesting a whole wild boar over the next six months, sources confirmed Friday. “Unfortunately, Mr. Bannon has already unhinged his jaw and must remain motionless through the the winter to properly digest the boar currently stored in his stomachs,” reads the statement issued through Bannon’s attorney, stressing that the former White House chief strategist had produced several gallons of highly pungent acid within his digestive track and found an ideal fungi-ridden stump where he could hibernate for months hidden away from potential predators. “It isn’t merely that it would be inconvenient to cooperate with this investigation given Mr. Bannon’s current semi-catatonic state. This subpoena doesn’t even attempt to accommodate the sizable fecal plug that my client has formed to trap nutrients from the boar skeleton as the bones dissolve in his bile. As such, we simply cannot accept these stringent demands.” At press time, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows had issued a similar statement arguing he could not comply with a subpoena because he was presently lodged inside Bannon’s digestive tract."
408,"WASHINGTON—Calling the smoldering ruins in downtown Des Moines a potential preview of 2024, pundits theorized Thursday that Donald Trump could be testing the waters for another presidential run by inciting Iowans to burn the state capitol to the ground. “While he has yet to formally announce his intention to run, the fact that Trump took the stage, raised a torch, and demanded the crowd sprint towards the Iowa Statehouse to set it ablaze is definitely a clue” said CNN analyst Chris Cillizza, adding that Trump sent out multiple feelers that day, which confirmed that voters were more than willing to rush the Iowa State Capitol, douse the building in gasoline, and throw in a lit match to ignite the flame. “While some were unsure if the former president had another campaign in him, he was successfully able to mobilize tens of thousands of Iowans to torch their state capitol and dance in the inferno. Frankly, if this isn’t a sign that he’ll run in 2024, I don’t know what is.” At press time, Cillizza noted that President Biden may want to watch out after photos surfaced of Trump unzipping his fly and urinating on the wreckage."

Never mind, I’m in!” “The key to compromise is demanding that you get everything you want while giving up nothing in return.” “Personally, I think compromise leads to half-hearted choices that feel safe but aren’t and that ultimately backfires terribly.” “All I know is I mumble that word once, and I get booked on every fucking Sunday talk show.” “Compromise? Never heard of it, but, sure, lay it on me.” “As a longtime Republican lawmaker, I’ve learned that digging in our heels accomplishes nothing but getting us everything we want.” “How dare you follow me into this press conference.” “Compromise comes from both Democratic and GOP leadership repeatedly telling me to shut up.” “Mine worked out great for a whole bunch of other people.” “Our constituents elected us to work together and reach across the aisle every few years and not really mean it.” “Back when I served in the Galactic Council, you could get atomized if you didn’t work with the other lifeforms. I think Earthlings could learn a lot from our extraterrestrial neighbors.” “If I compromised with my opponents, we never would’ve beaten Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl.” “Feinstein! Goodnight.” “Compromise? The January 6 protestors weren’t allowed to keep a single thing they grabbed in the Capitol.” “Um, do people not yet understand I want to bring this whole country to its knees?” “Compromise is important because it’s what every single one of my constituents had to do in order to convince themselves to vote for me.” “Yes,sir,it’s cows.” “If I can compromise my way to getting the hell out of Alaska, you can bet I’ll keep compromising so I never have to go back.” “Wow, really? No one ever asks me my opinion on anything. This is great. Most people see me and don’t even realize I’m a senator.

Anyone who’s ever seen her on TV or social media knows she’s a total bad ass. I mean, did you see those wigs? It just doesn’t make any sense. At least we still have Joe Manchin.” At press time, the nation had reached the conclusion that the pharmaceutical and medical industries must just also be really fucking cool."
411,"BERLIN—In a ceremony to commemorate her stepping down from her post as chancellor of Germany after 16 years, European Union officials honored Angela Merkel’s tenure Friday by giving her Greece. “We hope that the chancellor will accept the nation of Greece as a small parting gift to show our appreciation for her many years of service,” said European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, adding that after so many years of special attention she’d shown for the Mediterranean nation, it was only right that Greece would now be hers to do whatever she wanted with. “Chancellor Merkel has helped steer the countries of the European Union through many crises during her long tenure and established herself as one of the most influential leaders of our time, and she always made sure to include Greece in her plans. From the astounding history of Athens to the hundreds of islands to years of forced austerity measures, Greece has so much to offer a retired political leader of Ms. Merkel’s stature and tastes. A country of 11 million people isof course insufficient to convey the appreciation we all have for the chancellor, but it’s our way of thanking her for everything she’s done. With this gift, we’re able to ensure that Chancellor Merkel can continue to shape Greece in her image for many years to come.” At press time, Merkel was overheard commenting to her husband that it was just like the EU to try to stick her with some cheap, ugly old thing that no one in their right mind could want."

To see these desperate families with no better option available to them fail to take my message to heart—it shakes me to my core. It’s like they didn’t even hear me.” At press time, Harris announced she would be making an emergency trip to the border to meet with Haitian migrants and address their need to hear her say “I told you so.”"

The remaining 28% of Americans who said they would not swap democracy stated they would only do so for a gift certificate to a nice local bakery.” At press time, Felder confirmed that the results were the highest they’d been since 1996 when 80% of Americans stated that they would live under an Islamic theocracy in exchange for a $50 gift card to Radio Shack."
415,"WASHINGTON—Scrambling to respond to the sudden shift in electoral realities, Democrats reportedly faced new hurdles Wednesday after Republicans gerrymandered all left-leaning voters into a single House district stretching across the country. “Democrats were already lookingat significant headwinds going into the midterms, and that won’t be helped by having all of their voters gerrymandered into a new transcontinental district stretching from California to southern Maine,” said FiveThirtyEight founder Nate Silver, stressing that the Republican committee had likely hurt Democratic chances of retaining power in 2022 by combining previously separate districts such as California’s Eighteenth, Illinois’s First, New York’s Third, and a hundred more heavilyblue regions into a single House seat. “Of course, the mapmakers behind this new district insists its drawing was done in a nonpartisan fashion. But you can certainly see how Republicans might exploit the 434-1 advantage to move the legislature in a conservative direction.” At press time, DNC chair Jaime Harrison had released a press statement framing the new ultra-blue district’s single guaranteed seat as a major win for the nation’s progressives."
416,"WASHINGTON—Having thus far caved on eliminating the filibuster, advancing an adequate climate change agenda, and protecting voting rights, congressional Democrats told reporters Wednesday they were sick and tired of being blamed for cowardice on issues that, in reality, they just didn’t care about. “I’ve had it with being labeled spineless simply because, at the end of the day, I really don’t give a shit whether we tax the rich to help poor families or hungry children or whatever,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), stressing that his complete lack of interest in passing tough regulations for the financial services industry, supporting a Green New Deal, and ending the War on Terror hardly meant he was weak-willed or timid. “That’s so unfair. If these were issues Democrats truly cared about, then we’d  fight the Republicans tooth and nail on them. We’d even have the guts to risk the lucrative relationships we’ve formed with powerful corporations, defense contractors, and billionaire donors.

I’ve worked hard to block progressive legislation for years, and yet you don’t see my face plastered all over the news. Senator Manchin, we are calling on you to share the phone numbers and email addresses of your contacts at ABC News immediately. It’s time to think of the good of the party and share a bit of that limelight.” At press time, Coons added that it was repeated selfishness like this that made him question whether Manchin was really dedicated to maintaining the status quo."

Well, good luck to the House of Representatives working with this new LLC to write and pass new U.S. laws.” At press time, most of the members of the Senate announced they were moving into the private sector as well, opening Senate Executive Advisors, a new consultant firm that would provide governmental expertise to select U.S. client states."

423,"WASHINGTON—Shoving down barriers, sprinting up the steps, and smashing his fist through a thick pane of glass, bat-wielding Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH) burst through a Capitol window Thursday and demanded to be allowed onto a committee investigating the events of January 6th. “The January 6thcommittee was stolen,” yelled Jordan, while he and other representatives, including Rep.Jim Banks (R-IND), stormed through the House chamber, scribbling graffiti on statues, pepper-spraying police officers, and smearing his feces on the walls of Congress. “This entire investigation into the riots is a farce, but today, the probe will be reborn. We, the silent majority, will find out who really stormed the Capitol after the 2020 election. Finally, the truth will be revealed!” At press time, Jordan was spotted being transported to Walter Reed military hospital after allegedly suffering a heart attack while attempting to pick up a lectern and throw it against Nancy Pelosi’s office door."
424,"WASHINGTON—Clutching his briefcase and keeping his eyes averted as he approached, President Joe Biden rushed past an intimidating circle of senators smoking weed on the Capitol steps, sources confirmed Friday. “Excuse me, folks, just trying to get through here,” said the commander-in-chief, reportedly holding his breath as Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) blew smoke in his direction and laughingly offered him a toke from a lit joint. “Oh, uh, no thanks, haha. I’m running late. Plus, uh, I heard that stuff can make you go crazy.” At press time, a hyperventilating Biden was reportedly lying on the floor of the Oval Office trying to come down from a contact high."
425,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—Warning that the weak, calcified structures were particularly susceptible to critical failure, Ron DeSantis announced Wednesday that all Florida residents would be required to reinforce their bones with steel and concrete. “Starting today, all men, women, and children will be mandated to shore up their skeletal systems with columns, beams, and joists made of builder-grade cement and rebar,” said the governor, adding that residents would no longer be permitted to enter buildings, traverse bridges, or use any part of Florida’s crumbling infrastructure system unless all 206 bones in their bodies had been properly inspected, updated, and cleared by professional structural engineers to withstand over 10,000 tons of force. “Unfortunately, we’ve found that there are millions of residents currently living with outdated bones that, unbeknownst to them, will crack and splinter under the weight of a collapsing structure. Especially if your spine, skull, and ribcage have not been properly reinforced since the ’70s or ’80s, we urge you to bring them up to code immediately, lest you be fined, or worse, be crushed to death.” At press time, DeSantis added that zero state or federal funds would be diverted to the efforts, and all surgical reinforcements would have to come from Florida residents’ pockets."
426,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to educate the opposition party on the true value of civic engagement, congressional Democrats staged an elaborate 4th of July pageant Friday in an effort to teach their Republican colleagues the importance of democracy. Sources confirmed that the four-hour “star-spangled spectacular,” which involved months of preparation headed up by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, provided one blow-out night of freedom, fun, and refreshments. The Independence Day pageant, staged for the benefit of Congressional Republicans to promote consensus-building and working together, reportedly featured a variety of songs, dances, and skits from Democratic representatives tied to the loose theme of “America The Beautiful.” “The Republicans refuse to accept the majesty and preciousness of our democracy, and so we have no choice but to offer them this no-holds-barred, musical extravaganza,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), pointing to a scene in which Tim Kaine (D-VA) donned a dress and bonnet to portray Susan B. Anthony as well as members of the Oversight and Reform Committee filing into the auditorium playing “Yankee Doodle Dandy” on the recorder as particularly uplifting moments that helped convey the responsibility of honorably serving your constituents. “We’ve been rehearsing for months, learning choreography, and researching our state’s foods and traditions to really show how amazing this country can be, and our hope is that everybody who sees the show is going to come away feeling the weight of history on their shoulders, as well as humming a few classic patriotic tunes.” “It is not hyperbole to say that our nation is on the precipice of disaster,” continued Schumer. “So, we’ve been pulling out all the stops to make sure that every performance really dazzles.” Several eyewitness accounts revealed that the pageant featured involvement from every Democratic legislator except Joe Manchin (D-WV) who refused to participate if there were no Republican performers present. The patriotic program also included Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) proudly marching in place while singing “My Country ’Tis Of Thee” and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wearing a homemade Statue of Liberty costume and twirling on the stage with American flag handkerchiefs. Attendees confirmed that the show concluded with a lively, heartfelt climax in which the entire caucus held up sparklers while singing a medley including “This Land Is Your Land” and “You’re A Grand Old Flag,” adding that despite a few minor flubs, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) struggling for several minutes to light a cigarette while playing FDR and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) forgetting her line about California’s main exports and running offstage crying, it was a generally enjoyable event. According to sources, several Democrats expressed disappointment that no Republican officials had chosen to attend apart from Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), who reportedly only stayed long enough to fill a plate with red-white-and-blue sugar cookies before quickly exiting. “I can’t believe they learned all those lines,” said Heather Fenton, mother of Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA), confirming that she had gotten some priceless footage of her son and his friends in their “absolutely adorable” outfits. “I’ll admit, the speaker system was pretty spotty so you couldn’t always hear what they were saying, and the A/C stopped working halfway through so I stepped out for about half an hour, but you could really see all the hard work they put into this, and I just couldn’t be more proud of them.” “I’m not sure anyone who wasn’t a friend or family member would have enjoyed it,” Fenton continued. “But it made them feel like they could make a difference, and that’s the most important thing.”"
427,"WASHINGTON—Vowing to never again make the same mistake, the U.S. Department of Labor announced Friday that they would stop obsessing about counting jobs and just enjoy the economy for what it already is. “We’ve gotten so caught up with the whole jobs counting thing over the years that we forgot to appreciate all that the economy offers us right here and now,” said Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh, who proceeded to tear a copy of the latest U.S. jobs report in two and throw the scraps in the air before pronouncing that it was time for everyone to simply live and let live. “Look, we’ve done this bean counting grind every month for, what, eight decades? And where has it gotten us, huh? The jobs report is just a number. What’s really important is how the economy makes you feel. I mean, how many jobs does a rainbow make? How about a rainstorm? Do you dig what I’m putting down here?” At press time, Walsh was encouraging the newly laid off employees of the Bureau of Labor Statistics to take a deep breath and live in the moment."
428,"WASHINGTON—Calling the legislation “long overdue,” the U.S. Senate passed a bill Wednesday wishing younger generations the best of luck stopping climate change. “As devastating wildfires, flooding, and droughts sweep our planet, there has never been a more urgent time to shift the responsibility onto someone else,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who explained that the bill, called the SEE YA Act, or Saving the Earth Entrusted to Young Americans Act, would allocate over $100 billion toward putting up billboards across the country that read “Good luck!”with pictures of melting glaciers. “We cannot allow future generations to inherit this mess without at least saying ‘you got this’ and giving them a hearty pat on the back. It is crucial that we dedicate significant resources to these well wishes. We know they have their work cut out for them, which is why every American under 18 will also receive a personalized signed photo of their representatives dusting off their hands and grimacing.” At press time, President Joe Biden had vetoed the bill on the grounds it would be viewed as too radical."
429,"WASHINGTON—Shaking his head and sighing while poking around various rotting, dilapidated sections of the 3.8-million-square-mile country, local contractor Randy Alonzo looked President Joe Biden in the eye Fridayand told him that it wouldbe cheaperjustto tear down the United States and start over. “Yeah, no, I’ll be honest, this whole friggin’ place, from California to New York, all the way down to the tip of Florida, is a mess, and if I were you, I’d just consider shit-canning the whole thing and building back from the ground up,” said Alonzo, adding that while he was fully expecting to find some disrepair in a 244-year-old nation, he wasn’t prepared for a total “gut job” with lead pipes in every major city, huge cracks all up and down the west coast, standing water throughout the south, as well as an unidentifiable toxic sludge all throughout the midwest. “I just don’t see any way we can save this.  Are you aware Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee were all built on floodplains? And I can’t even tell my guys to start inspecting Pennsylvania without the proper hazmat suits, given all the asbestos. Listen, I get that there’s a lot of historical charm that you want to save in New England and everything, but that stuff hasn’t really been maintained since 1960. If I were you, I’d try to start finding some more money for this reno, because that $6 billion bipartisan deal isn’t exactly going to cut it.”  Alonzo confirmed he could technically cut corners and just do cosmetic upgrades, but unless he shored up the foundation, Biden would have a real hard time unloading a rat-infested, fire-prone, depreciating country on the next guy."
430,"WASHINGTON—In a devastating setback to negotiations that have been plagued for weeks by partisan gridlock, sources confirmed Friday that infrastructure talks in Congress came to a halt after a giant sinkhole opened up beneath the Capitol, swallowing the building and its occupants whole. “Unfortunately, our attempts to reach an agreement on this urgently needed investment in America have stalled again, this time because the ground under our feet gave way and hundreds of senators and representatives were sucked into a gaping void deep within the earth,” said Senate Majority Leader  Chuck Schumer, adding that while progress had been made on a plan that would cover transportation, broadband, and clean water, it was impossible to proceed now that both congressional chambers and the lawmakers necessary for a quorum had plummeted into the darkness of a massive pit that appeared to have no bottom. “Unfortunately, just after the Senate rejected an amendment to pay for the spending with a tax on the rich, the building shook violently, collapsed in on itself, and tumbled into the emptiness below. A few of us managed to survive by clinging to a rocky outcropping and waiting several hours for a rescue helicopter. But most members are missing and presumed to be plunging downward, forever, unto their doom. At this point, the only indications of their survival are the horrifying screams of ‘Nay’ echoing from the eternal depths of a half-mile-wide crater where Capitol Hill used to be.” Reached by phone for comment, Senator Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would allow certain sections of the infrastructure bill to proceed so long as someone promised to throw him a rope before the flames rising beneath him completely enveloped his body and burned him alive."

Honestly, this was just the short escape I needed, but it’ll be nice to be back home and away from the chaos of the big city with a few mementos from our time here. I wish I could bring back a slice of pizza, but that probably won’t travel well on the plane.” Yang continued that even though the vacation was great, he probably wouldn’t go back to New York City anytime soon because of all the unpleasant mentally ill people he saw roaming the streets."
432,"NEW YORK—Estimating the process could take weeks, New York City election officials confirmed Wednesday that results for the mayoral primary would be delayed until they finished watching a YouTube explainer on ranked choice voting. “While we’re pretty sure who’s leading, we still need to watch a few more videos to help us understand how votes are allocated and why we’re doing this at all,” said Board of Elections president Frederic Umane, who implored voters to remain patient while officials poredthrough thousands of vlogs and colorful infographics promising to explain the electoral system in 60 seconds orless. “We got close to finding a YouTuber who explained the whole thing clearly, but then he lost us with a little rant about score voting halfway through. Our attention span is very short, so hold tight. We have a lot of videos queued up, and a lot of five-second ads to get through. Plus, we keep getting distracted by all these recommended Richard Feynman and Counting Crows videos.” At press time, election officials announced results would be delayed indefinitely after stumbling across a video from PragerU."
433,"NEW YORK—Clucking his tongue with mock disappointment, Bill De Blasio announced to New Yorkers that “It’s not so easy to find a mayor that doesn’t suck shit after all, huh?” during a press conference Tuesday. “Hey, you all gave it your best shot, but it looks like it’s a little harder than you thought to run a candidate who won’t be a national fucking disgrace, doesn’t it?” said De Blasio, smirking as he suggested that the voting public had perhaps gotten a little too big for their britches at the prospect of electing someone who would amount to more than a constant source of embarrassment for the city at large. “But, no, really, I hope you have a goddamn blast with Eric Adams or whatever asshole you end up going with, and I’m sure you’ll knock everybody’s socks off with some really incredible candidates during the next election cycle. Just goes to show that it’s not so easy to find someone who isn’t a total dickhead hated by everybody.” At press time, De Blasio had issued a joint statement along with Mike Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani that consisted of them loudly laughing for 10 straight minutes."
434,"NEW YORK—Smiling broadly as he entered the polling place, mayoral candidate Andrew Yang tried to buy a banana from a voting booth, election workers confirmed Tuesday. “I’ll have a banana and a coffee, then I’ll get out of your hair—you’re not cash only, are you?” said Yang, who muttered “only in New York” as he searched his ballot for the appropriate bubble to fill in to leave room in  his coffee for cream. “Wow, this is so great. I love that there’s so many places in NYC where you can just pop in and grab what you want. My first choice is a banana and a coffee, but I guess my second choice is an everything bagel with extra cream cheese. Third choice is a bagel with lox. Fourth choice is, uh, I don’t know, just lox? God, I love it here. Am I doing this right?” At press time, Yang had taken a big bite out of his folded-up ballot and declared that it was only because of the tap water that you could get something so delicious here."
435,"WASHINGTON—Urging the nation to get a head start on what they described as an inevitable decision, the Brookings Institute released a statement Tuesday encouraging Americans to start thinking about what form of government they would like to try after democracy crumbles. “We’re urging this country’s citizens to really put their heads together on how they’d like the country to be governed after the federal government ultimately implodes and leaves a massive power vacuum,” said policymaking expert James Kimberly, explaining to the country’s 330 million residents that there were some “really cool” options to consider for the post-democracy America, ranging from a constitutional monarchy to an outright banana republic. “How about a totalitarian dictatorship? Anarcho-syndicalism? Or, hey, Japan did some cool stuff with a shogun back in the day. Nothing saying we can’t have an American shogun. There’s also always complete chaos to consider, which would make a lot of sense given where we’re heading. All we’re saying is that we should get the ball rolling on this, because we don’t want to get caught with our pants down whenever Washington D.C. is left a smoldering crater.” At press time, the nation had unanimously decided that after U.S. democracy collapsed, they would pursue sharia law."
436,"WASHINGTON—Buoyed by their success in restricting female reproductive rights, the GOP reportedly launched a new legislative effort Monday to control women’s pancreases. “Every day, women are using pancreatic enzymes to break down food without any consideration for the sanctity of these innocent carbohydrates, proteins, and fats,” said Jim Jordan (R-OH), announcing a new spate of bills that severely limit the types of procedures women can undergo on the digestive organ while also cutting funding for gastroenterologists and endocrinologists across the country. “We spend all this time worrying about women’s rights, but what about the mass slaughter of glycogens that’s taking place throughout our nation? Are the undigested not worthy of protection as well?” At press time, the Republican Party had unveiled a new law that would require women to watch a video of a pancreas creating glucose before they’d be allowed to undergo a pancreaticoduodenectomy."
437,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concern that a lack of restraints on the burgeoning technological field may post significant consequences down the road, President Joe Biden  reportedly pressed a cybernetic replica of himself Thursday on the growing threat of automation. “President Biden had a delicate but important conversation with his automated doppelgänger concerning unregulated developments in artificial intelligence posing a potential threat to American security down the line, and the doppelgänger was very receptive,” said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, adding that the replica that shared every one of the president’s memories and points of judgment sat mirroring Joe Biden for a productive 90-minute meeting. “The president was pleased by his cybernetic copy’s responses, as it seemed to anticipate every one of his questions, as well as his gestures, actions, and thoughts, which goes a long way toward assuaging the administration’s concerns. The automaton assured the president that any concerns about artificial intelligence becoming uncontrollable by humans are likely years away, and that it had already assumed oversight of the U.S. intelligence apparatus dedicated to investigating cyber threats to guide its research priorities. President Biden was also happy to discuss classified aspects of U.S. foreign policy that the automaton said would greatly enhance its own independent machine-learning capacities, and we look forward to working with the indistinguishably realistic President Biden cybernetic copy on future projects.” At press time, the cybernetic Biden had torn off Biden’s head and declared itself president for life."
438,"WASHINGTON—In a rare unanimous vote, the Senate passed a bill Wednesday to make Juneteenth a federal holiday so long as no one thinks too hard about its significance. “This is a day to barbecue and get drunk, a day to ask your coworkers what they’re planning to do with their long weekend, and most of all a day to not ask too many questions about what it means or why we’re celebrating,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who encouraged the nation to commemorate the occasion just as they would any other federal holiday by sleeping in, taking a trip to the beach, or shopping the great Juneteenth sales at stores like Home Depot and Old Navy. “Maybe it’s about the Civil War, maybe it’s about the Constitution, but the important point is we’re drinking a few margaritas and not diving too deep into its historical significance past the word ‘slavery.’ Otherwise, it’s just going to open a whole can of worms. In fact, on second thought, the word ‘slavery,’ is maybe a little charged, so maybe we’ll just leave that out as well.” At press time, Schumer shared his hopes that Juneteenth would one day be celebrated everywhere across the country under a much more vague moniker such as “Freedom Day.”"

Q: Why did Trump seek intelligence on politicians, journalists, and others?A: He wanted to be able to surprise them with the perfect gift. Q: Are investigations of this kind out of the ordinary?A: Yes, normally they’re covered up better. Q: What’s the benefit of calling Trump officials to testify about this now?A: Some photos of congressional Democrats looking tough to use in 2024 campaign ads. Q: Is Trump responsible for this?A: Per the Constitution, the president is not responsible for any actions resulting from his direct orders. Q: Why didn’t Biden’s DOJ come forward to expose their predecessor’s secret investigations?A: A little something called class. Q: What did Trump’s Justice Department discover?A: Apple’s pathetic willingness to cooperate with the government. Q: What are the long-term consequences of this scandal?A: 3 to 5 news cycles. Q: What lesson can we learn from this?A: That anyone who reports on government spying will also be spied on."
440,"WASHINGTON—Securing a rare bipartisan consensus as both parties acknowledged the growing influence of the nation’s biggest geopolitical rival, the U.S. Senate passed a bill Monday allocating $50 billion to compete directly with China by developing pandas on American soil. “If we continue to rely on China for these highly sought-after bears, we may one day wake up and discover we no longer have an adequate supply of giant pandas,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, explaining that if the United States failed to make a substantial investment in its panda infrastructure now, it might find itself forever at the mercy of a powerful Chinese monopoly. “But the days of depending on foreign pandas such as Tian Tian and Mei Xiang will soon be behind us. Over the next decade, our domestic panda program will produce bears that are larger, cuter, and can consume bamboo at twice the rate of their Chinese counterparts. Ask yourself, who should be deciding where these adorable animals are dispatched in nations across the globe? China or the United States? I think the answer is clear, and that’s what this bill represents.” Passage of the bill follows recent intelligence reports indicating China now has the ability, through its panda loan program, to shut down America’s entire network of zoos with a single command from Beijing."
441,"WASHINGTON—Calling the incident a minor hiccup and saying the European trip would continue as planned, the White House was reportedly forced to delay a press flight Wednesday after President Joe Biden got into the plane’s engine. “As soon as we remove the president from the turbine, we should be able to proceed as scheduled,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters, adding that an auxiliary power unit had been rendered inoperable after the commander-in-chief crawled into a turbine looking for a snack he dropped. “Unfortunately, the president got pretty well wedged in there, so rescue crews have spent a few hours already trying to get him out. He got pretty startled, naturally, and crawled further in. Fortunately we’ve coaxed him closer to leaving the engine, and once we repair the wires he chewed, the diplomatic trip should hopefully continue without incident.” At press time, the flight had been delayed again on the runway after the president had somehow gotten back into the engine."
442,"WASHINGTON—In the latest overture to secure a deal with congressional Republicans, President Joe Biden made a significant concession in ongoing infrastructure negotiations Monday by partially demolishing the Brooklyn Bridge. “Look, if we’re ever going to move past the contentiousness of the past four years, we need to leave the door open to bipartisan compromises like detonating C4 charges across the Brooklyn Bridge to level half the structure,and that’s exactly what I’ve done,” said the president in a press conference that praised conservatives Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Susan Collins (R-ME) for remaining “flexible and pragmatic” on their calls to blow up all six of the bridge’s trusses. “Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come a long way by agreeing to drop their demands to scuttle the Staten Island Ferry. Plus, half of the Brooklyn Bridge is still standing. That’s a major win forprogressives.” Biden added that Democrats could also frame the iconic bridge’s destruction as an opportunity for any commuters who want to drive their cars directly into the East River."
443,"WASHINGTON—Arguing the procedure was an invaluable legislative tradition that she would be hard pressed to do away with, Sen.Krysten Sinema (D-AZ) defended the Senate filibuster Friday as necessary for her to stay politically relevant. “For years, the Senate filibuster has been a critical tool that senators like myself have used in order to propel ourselves out of obscurity and into the spotlight,” said Sinema, adding that the ability to delay or block a bill protected a time-honored system in the United States government that had given her undue power based on a lack of proportional representation. “I admit our government has problems, but permitting Republicans to take the Senate floor to stymie a piece of legislation, which results in Krysten Sinema becoming the most talked-about senator in the news,is not one of them. Perhaps my Democratic colleagues should consider becoming relevant themselves, rather than removing the system that allowed my success.” At press time, Sinema argued that the best way to protect democracy was not by eliminating the filibuster, but rather bycontinuing to give her attention again and again."
444,"PROVIDENCE, RI—As congress continued their months-long negotiation over President Joe Biden’s proposed spending plan, a pundit from Politico strongly asserted Friday that “the time is running out to reach an infrastructure deal,” slamming on the gas pedal in an effort to outpace the highway crumbling behind him. “If the Biden administration is genuine about reaching a bipartisan deal this week, this is a make-or-break moment for America’s interstates,” said editorial contributor Nate Graham speeding south on I-295, drifting as he tried to avoid a toppling bridge tower, cracks spreading through the asphalt as he swerved toward an exit, then careening through the air as a clover-shaped ramp system collapsed. “While bipartisanship is a noble goal, it can’t come at the expense of actual progress—look out! Reconciliation might be the only option left—that is, if anyone involved can set aside their pride and egos in the name of progress. Incoming!” At press time, Graham had begun dissecting the proposed budget allotments for roads and waterways as his car somersaulted into a massive crater where exit 6 used to be."
445,"LOS ANGELES—Explaining that he had taken the measure to send a message that she could not stay there, L.A. mayor Eric Garcetti told reporters Friday that he was preventing his kid from lazing about by installing spikes on the family couch. “I’ve told her repeatedly that she can’t be sitting around occupying the couch all the time while working people are trying to live here, but she won’t act reasonably,” said Garcetti, adding that covering the couch and other sitting areas of the family home in  sharp steel spikes would ensure that his 9-year-old daughter would not just sit around all daybeing an unproductive member of society. “We need to figure out a way to humanely deter our daughter,so her mother and I can move about the house freely and without having to look at any unkempt sleeping children. We actually used a well-known designer to make the spikes, and they fit into the architecture of the living room quite nicely.” Garcetti added that if the couch spikes did not adequately deter his daughter from lazing about the house, he was considering removing the roof of his home and exposing her to the elements so she would find somewhere else to go."
446,"NEW YORK—Listening enraptured as the most powerful people in the world discussed their process, the United States Congress took a field trip to Goldman Sachs headquarters Thursday to learn about how laws get made. “I’ve always wondered how the government decides who is allowed to do what, so it’s really cool to hear how the people in charge make those decisions,” said Illinois representative Cheri Bustos, who stood in line with fellow members of Congress as they received a guided tour of the hallowed Goldman Sachs board room. “I thought it would be boring, but all the stuff about weighing the impact on their bottom line versus the effects of potentially hurting their government tax handouts was really interesting. Plus, the building is so beautiful and modern. It makes me think that I should try and be an investment banker so I can help make these decisions one day.” At press time, the members of the field trip were  treated to complimentary gift bags that included watches, vouchers for first-class flights, and $100,000 campaign donations."

As more and more Americans turn to electric power, we must protect our farmers. I’m dedicated to working with President Hoover on this.” At press time, Feinstein added that she continued to oppose statehood for Alaska as aides escorted her back to her office."
448,"WASHINGTON—Faced with obstacles to his policy proposals that threatened to derail their passage, President Joe Biden on Tuesday reportedly expressed his concern that his ambitious agenda could be stalled by him not really caring if it happens or not. “I came into office with a mandate to enact big, bold legislation that would improve the lives of everyday Americans, but we still face the significant obstacle of it not particularly mattering to me whether we ever actually do that,” said Biden, warning that campaign promises like eliminating student loan debt, passing large-scale infrastructure reform, and reducing income inequality don’t have a chance of happening if he can’t get himself on board. “We can talk all we want about protecting voting rights or improving our healthcare system, but ultimately it doesn’t matter if I don’t   have any real stake in making those  changes happen. Frankly, it’s possible we will never get these things across the finish line unless I start to give a shit.” Biden also cautioned that even if he did start  ramping up public pressure to enact his ambitious agenda, it could still be stalled in Congress by dozens of Democrats who also don’t give a flying fuck whether or not it ever passes."
449,"WASHINGTON—Unsettled by the direction in which their party appeared to be headed, a small group of Republicans expressed concern Monday that blind worship of former President Donald Trump had begun to erode more traditional GOP values, such as the blind worship of former President Ronald Reagan. “It’s deeply troubling to me that the Republican Party has devolved into little more than a cult of personality fixated on someone other than Ronald Reagan,” said Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL), who observed that the lionization of a man who over the past four years made life worse for millions of Americans was a dangerous distraction from the lionization of a man who did the same thing but in the 1980s. “It’s disconcerting, with Trump, to see a charismatic entertainer hailed as the ultimate Republican despite a very troubling legacy. That’s supposed to be Reagan’s role. When it comes to the unquestioning acceptance of a man who demonized minorities and made rich people richer at the expense of working families, we must always direct our abject fealty toward the 40th president, not the 45th.” Later in the day, after meeting with GOP congressional leaders and receiving numerous calls from top donors, Kinzinger acknowledged Trump was indeed one of the greatest leaders our country had ever had."
450,"WASHINGTON—White House sources revealed Thursday that the Oval Office had been temporarily closed for cleaning after President Biden’s dog Major vomited a partially digested Secret Service agent onto the carpet. “Major is in good health and resting comfortably, and the office will be open as soon as a maintenance crew has finished scrubbing the floor of human remains,” said Press Secretary Jen Psaki, confirming that Biden’s German shepherd had been whining and moaning throughout the morning before ultimately disgorging what appeared to be an ear and a pair of sunglasses directly onto the presidential seal. “Major will be receiving additional obedience training, and we’ll be updating his diet to ensure that he’s receiving the requisite nutrients and won’t wander off to snack on any White House staff members or visiting dignitaries.” At press time, the National Mall had been shuttered until further notice after Major defecated the remainder of the agent into the Reflecting Pool."
451,"WASHINGTON—After weeks of tense negotiation between Democratic and Republican leaders, Congress reached a compromise Wednesday to investigate the events of Jan. 9. “The attack on the Capitol was a notorious day in American history that we still have many questions about, which is why we’re pleased to announce the formation of the Jan. 9 Commission, a day pretty close to it,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who confirmed that lawmakers had reached a bipartisan agreement to create an independent committee examining lawmakers’ rhetoric and exactly what happened on  Jan. 9. “We thank Republicans for agreeing on the importance of investigating at least one day in January. There have been reports that the custodial staff waxed the floor that day, and street surveillance footage shows that there was a taco truck with a long line parked around the corner. We might not have gotten everything we wanted with this agreement, but the spirit of bipartisanship is alive and well.” At press time, Schumer added that the commission would also be investigating threats made on social media that could be tied to a Capitol bathroom sink that began leaking on Jan. 9."
452,"WASHINGTON—Saying he could probably just sit at the back and dose off without anyone bothering him, slacker congressman Scott Chrysler told reporters Wednesday he was praying to get a bullshit assignment this term, like the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. “Are you kidding me? Climate Crisis? That’s a total blow-off assignment for sure,” said Chrysler, adding that while the climate committee was his first choice, he ultimately would be happy with any low-pressure assignment, including Education and Labor or Veterans’ Affairs. “On Climate Crisis, there’s no way you’ll get one of those committee chairs who busts your chops all the time. I won’t have the party whip on my ass, either, because no one in the House leadership will care what goes on in a committee about the environment. Seriously, how many people in Congress even understand how climate change works? I certainly don’t. I bet all you have to do is put out a couple half-assed statements about windmills or whatever. Oh, man, if I get on there, I am gonnacruisethrough this session!” At press time, Chrysler reportedly let out a groan upon learning he had been assigned to the Armed Services Committee."

454,"TOKYO—Saying that he had done his own research but wanted to get a real local’s point of view, newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel reportedly asked his hosts Tuesday to recommend the best black sites to visit. “So, if I’m hanging out by the American embassy in Tokyo, where are the best places I can go and spend the afternoon watching interrogators coerce confessions out of prisoners in a CIA holding cell,” said Emanuel, while also reminding his guides that he had high standards for clandestine detainment centers, especially after being the mayor of Chicago. “Hey, I’m in a new country, with a new job, and I figure, what’s a better way to get to know the locals than to go straight to a state-sanctioned secret prison or two? And don’t send me to any of those lame underground bunkers you just take the new politicians on their welcometours. I want to get down and dirty, maybe even torture someone myself.” At press time, Emanuel shocked his hosts by rattling off the names of several black sites they had never even heard of, and handing them classified papers on each of the detainees he wanted to meet."
455,"NEW YORK—Accusing educators of brainwashing children with a liberal agenda of barnyard sounds, conservative pundits criticized local preschool Butler Academy Monday for silencing right-wing animal voices. “Every day, our children get sent to schools just like this, and are brainwashed by antifa teachers who believe that cows, chickens, and pigs only speak one way,” said Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), who held up a picture book, flipped through the pages, and demanded to know why there wasn’t a single conservative “moo,” “baa,” or “oink” to be found. “All I see here is a bunch of chickens who are clearly part of the East Coast elite, clucking and teaching our children that the only way to make farm noises is to go to Harvard. Well, to that I saythis is how real American animals talk:cock-a-doodle-doo.” At press time, conservative pundits had called a teacher from the preschool in order to shame her for only teaching left-wing shapes."
456,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concerns about an overly ambitious agenda, several politically moderate members of Congress issued a joint statement Monday calling for smaller numbers. “The proposals that our colleagues are putting forward, at times, contain figures with as many as seven or eight digits in them, which is simply beyond the pale,” said Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), warning that these large numbers with multiple commas risked alienating key voter blocs. “My constituents didn’t send me to D.C. to inundate them with radically high numbers like a million or a billion. No, I came here to fight for figures like 12,or 7, or better yet, 1/8. These are the type of meat-and-potatoes numbers that American voters can get behind. I have no wish to be unreasonable—my fellow moderates and I recognize the importance of values greater than zero, but there’s simply no cause for them to be this big.” At press time, Manchin had moved on to castigating Democrats for writing bills featuring words other than “bipartisan.”"
457,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to help cover costs for working families, President Joe Biden rolled out his child-care plan Wednesdayallowing all American parents to drop their kids off at the White House between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m.“Starting today, you can drop your tykes right off at the front gate, where a senior adviser will check your child in and escort them to the West Wing,” said Biden, who touted the new program as a convenient centralized location for families from the Mid-Atlantic, Southeastern, and Midwest regions, as well as only a short drive away for those living in the West and Southwest. “We understand how hard it is to be a working parent, so please feel free to bring them down. We’ve allocated over $200 billion for pudding cups, crayons, and dodgeballs for kids of all ages to enjoy. They can explore the Roosevelt Room and dig in the Rose Garden. The White House chef is currently preparing 700,000 PB&Js, so let us know if your child has a nut allergy. But please be warned, if your child does not behave, we will not hesitate to send them to theGuantánamoBay detention camp.” At press time, Biden added that all children who had not been picked up by 5:30 p.m. would be made wards of theDepartment of Health and Human Services."
458,"WASHINGTON—Speaking out against H.R. 51, which has now cleared the House and made its way to the Senate, congressional Republicans argued Friday that granting Washington, D.C. statehood would be a slippery slope to the District one day becoming its own planet. “If the tiny District of Columbia is admitted as the 51st state, what’s to stop it from going on to ask for recognition as a sovereign country, continent, or planetary body?” Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) said in an impassioned plea to senators, warning them to stop the bill or risk emboldening D.C. to slowly grow more spherical and, before long, call for its release from Earth’s gravitational pull. “Sure, we could give in to the District’s demands for representation in Congress, but pretty soon it will expect its own orbital path around the sun—a blatant power grab for Democrats that would throw off the balance of the whole solar system. It was just a few years ago that we acknowledged Pluto wasn’t big enough to be a planet. Do we now want to grant that status to a town of less than 70 square miles? Please.” Mace went on to add that if Democrats succeeded in passing H.R. 51, there would be nothing left to stop California from spiraling into its own liberal galaxy."
459,"WASHINGTON—Moments after the international summit commenced, President Joe Biden attempted to steer world leaders away from the depressing topic of climate change by asking if anyone had seen the Apple+ sitcomTed Lasso. “Before we move onto that IPCC models stuff, I wanted to ask: Anyone seen this new sitcom? Basically, it’s a classic fish-out-of-water setup about an American soccer coach in England—and, let me say, Jason Sudeikis plays the role to a tee,” said the president, addressing the largely silent foreign diplomats as he described a running gag involving Lasso bringing in homemade cookies to his ornery boss as an encapsulation of the show’s charm, before turning to Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga to explain that it was the same guy who madeScrubsandCougar Town. “Now, I’ll be the first to admit it can get a little treacly at time, but this isn’t a show that’s trying to reinvent the wheel. Sometimes,you just want something to pick you up after a long day at work. Oh wait, let me show you this clip of Sudeikis accepting his Golden Globe. I promise you’ll like this, Macron.” At press time, Biden had cut off a discussion about dangerous concentrations of hydrofluorocarbons in the atmosphere to announce unprompted that he could really go for some Indian food right about now."
460,"WASHINGTON—Declaring that the new $2 trillion proposal was unrealistic, GOP leaders  reportedly voiced their opposition Tuesday to President Joe Biden’s infrastructure bill with an uplifting reminder that it is okay to be a work in progress. “What this proposal calls for is nothing less than a set of completely unhelpful expectations that every single bridge, road, and sewage system needs to conform to some rigorous set of perfect standards,” said Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that lawmakers should instead be focusing on legislation that supported electrical grids and waste treatment facilities that were still figuring some stuff out. “Infrastructure comes in all shapes and sizes, and in all different conditions and levels of functionality, and we Republicans think that’s beautiful. It is irresponsible to compare one of our older trains or pothole-filled streets to ahigh-speed rail in Japan or utilities in Germany when it is perfectly fine to set your own benchmarks for success and work toward them at your own pace. This bill would put unnecessary pressure on our nation’s infrastructure to live up to impossible goals.” GOP officials added that throwing money around would only cause dependence on Congress and that it would be much more meaningful if the nation’s infrastructure was instead permitted to improve itself entirely on its own."

462,"WASHINGTON—Calling the proposed law “dangerous” and “unprecedented”, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) decried a new voting rights bill Thursday as a shameless power grab by the American people to control the country. “The proposed legislation is nothing more than a brazen attempt by the calculating American people to seize congress by electing representatives,” said Cruz, who warned that the nation’s 328 million residents “would stop at nothing” to carry out their sinister ploy. “There’s no way the U.S. population would be pushing for voting rights if it didn’t mean there was something to be gained. It’s a transparent attempt to drive Republicans out of power by allowing Americans who have opinions contrary to our own to vote against us, and we won’t stand for it. Clearly, the American people are way out of touch with the GOP.” At press time, Cruz had raised concerns the bill would lead to a wave of non-senators casting ballots."
463,"ATLANTA—Stressing the importance of providing a welcoming environment unimpeded by bureaucratic red tape, Georgia lawmakers warned Wednesday that stricter gun regulations would only cause mass shooters to move to other states. “Georgia cannot and must not make itself a state that can’t compete with the rest of the country, and, indeed, the globe, in offering a world-class market for shooting fatalities,” said Georgia state senator Butch Miller, describing how proposals such as a five-day waiting period and closing gun show loopholes would simply drive unhinged shooters to relocate their mass-killing operations to more deregulated states like Texas and Arizona. “Let’s be clear: A lack of regulation helped make this stateattractive to deranged murderers with something to prove in the first place. Imposing these liberal-backed policies will only compel these killers to search for greener pastures elsewhere—and frankly, I wouldn’t blame them.” Miller went on to argue that if the Democrat-led effort had its way, the  shooters might even be forced to bring these mass casualties abroad to Mexico or China."
464,"Whether they’re a fresh-faced junior senator or a seven-term veteran, every cog in the American political machine has to start somewhere. We interviewed members of the U.S. Senate and asked them to describe the moment they were inspired to run for office. “On my college debate team I would pick the most dipshit, indefensible positions and argue them until it irritated everyone in the room, so becoming a senator was the natural next step.” “As a teenager, I remember accidentally biting my tongue while eating a corndog at the state fair. It hurt intensely, but that was my first taste of blood.” “Someone told me senators ride the Cyclone for free.” “I always wanted to see the big city lights in Washington and figured winning an all-expenses-paid trip via a Congressional seat might be my best shot.” “Honestly, everyone in Wyoming just takes turns. There are only, like, 10 people that live here.” “Who’s asking?” “After graduating from Yale I mapped out what the future could hold and I realized that, with hard work and a bit of luck, I could rise high enough to impress Rosario Dawson.” “As a former astronaut who’s spent time exploring the dead, barren wasteland of the moon, I thought, ‘Maybe Arizona is doable after all.’” “I’m a Senator?” “I coached football. And Alabamans just want to Roll Tide, so what else am I going to do? Also, it didn’t seem that hard. The guy that stalked teenagers almost won.” “As soon as I heard about the mistresses, I was in!” “I realized from a very young age that the U.S. Capitol was nicer than my apartment.” “I was in college interning Rep. Ros-Lehtinen. I’d just finished sending out a stack of contradictory memos, and I offered to stay late emailing generic responses to press inquiries. She looked at me and said ‘Kid, you’re gonna go far.’ I’ll never forget it.” “In 1978, I walked into an open field and in a flash, I emerged with my hair cropped and grey and having won the 2001 senatorial election in Delaware. Oddly enough, the field was in Kansas.” “Since I was a small child, I have always wanted to be forced to settle for Senator of Utah.” “As the daughter of a a veteran and a homemaker with a hardscrabble middle-class upbringing, I always knew my origin story would fucking kill in politics.” “I just thought it would be cool to die in the Senate.” “I really liked the look of my name on a poster, and I guess people caught on.” “Becoming a senator was the only thing I could think of that would come close to matching the high of owning and operating a regional chain of restaurants.” “Look. I grew up on a pig farm in Iowa. And if you can castrate a pig, then you can do anything.”"
465,"WASHINGTON—Blastingthe critics of surging migrant detentions, President Joe Biden claimed Monday that it was unfair to attack his administration over borders that former President James K. Polk was responsible for creating. “It’s absurd, we just got here, and now we are being blamed for a lack of transparency around migrant detentioneven though we obviously inherited this border from Polk,” said Biden, who attacked his critics for ignoring the clear fact that border crossings started 172 years before he took office. “We have a delicate situation here, and we inherited a real mess from the incompetent Polk administration. They started this problem by pushing the border south to the Rio Grande. If you want to blame someone go talk to Winfield Scott and James Buchanan.” At press time, Biden was also dismissing criticism over the minimum wage fight by pointing to inherent flaws of representative democracy he inherited from the 509 B.C. Roman Assembly."
466,"WASHINGTON—In a sign of growing party consensus on Capitol Hill, reports confirmed Friday that all 50 Senate Democrats have signaled their openness to restoring the filibuster to its original form as a drawn-out and highly provocative striptease act. “The filibuster is nothing but a tool for obstruction without the old rules requiring senators to hold the floor with a slow, exotic dance routine in which they gradually remove all their clothes,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), explaining why he believes the practice of stalling a piece of legislation for hours at a time must be accompanied by a lawmaker seductively peeling off one garment after another, only to hide his or her body from view behind a fan of ostrich feathers until three-fifths of the senators invoke cloture and bring the show to a close. “This is what sets our chamber apart from the House: a rule that empowers the minority to use a gradual buildup of sexual arousal to stop a bill. Say what you will about my colleague Ted Cruz, but when he ripped off his tearaway three-piece suit to Ginuwine’s “Pony” and revealed those pink glitter pasties during his filibuster to defund the Affordable Care Act, we were all impressed with his determination to bump and grind for his principles.” According to congressional aides, Democrats are still debating the smaller details surrounding merkins and nipple tassel requirements."

468,"WASHINGTON—Alleging rampant misuse of the inflatable transparent plastic sphere, an inspector general’s report released Monday showed that former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao violated ethics guidelines when she ran personal errands in a government Zorb. “Though federal rules dictate it is only to be used for official Transportation Department business, Secretary Chao routinely rolled around in the Zorb to pick up her dry cleaning or stop by the bank,” the report read in part, stating that Chao was often seen taking a spin down Capitol Hill to Foggy Bottom in the Zorb, only to call her aides to help roll her back up again. “The American taxpayer was on the hook for this improper use, including for the purchase of multiple rolls of duct tape to patch up the rips from all the times it popped. Despite this, she continued to use the Zorb for personal travel and even let family members—including her husband, Sen. Mitch McConnell, and her father, 93-year-old shipping magnate James Chao—use it to roll down all the best slopes in the D.C. area.” Reporters attempting to reach Chao were told she was using the Zorb to take a lazy river ride down the Potomac and thus unavailable for comment."
469,"ALBANY, NY—Choking back tears while addressing the crowd of clamoring reporters, New York governor Andrew Cuomo expressed deep regret Friday that grandma didn’t have the balls to tough it out. “From the bottom of my heart, let me just say to the press, to my constituents, andmost importantlyto all the people I’ve hurtthat I am so sorry that nana couldn’t nut up, put on her big boy pants, and tough it out for just a few measly months,” said Cuomo, taking a deep breath, shaking his head, and acknowledging how devastating it must be for someone’s family member to go out like such a big pussy. “At the time, I didn’t understand how my actions would affect people, especially the elderly who decided to throw in the towel instead of growing a fucking pair. While I can’t change the past, I can work on moving forwardand always remembering what a little bitch these people were to the end.” At press time, Cuomo added that he would not be stepping down,before he grabbed his genitals and said he’d only wish your grandma had some stones like these."
470,"WASHINGTON—Responding swiftly to the credible threat, Congress was reportedly forced to cancel its Thursday session after authorities warned of a looming plot to pass the stimulus bill. “Intelligence officials have informed us of a deeply unsettling plot to pass a nearly $2 trillion stimulus bill—a frightening plot that may have involved members of the House of Representatives itself,” said Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), who confirmed that his fellow legislators in the Senate were taking every precaution necessary to keep the alarming relief plan at bay. “Many of the details are still unclear, but we know they’ve been plotting this for months. We have reason to believe it may go as far back as the Georgia runoffs. If these disturbing reports of a child tax credit are true, we may have to erect a permanent fence around the Capitol building to keep everybody out.” At press time, Johnson added that if this plot hadn’t been intercepted, millions of Americans could have gotten the financial assistance they needed."
471,"BONN, GERMANY—Agreeing that public perception of how they were handling the climate crisis had never been more important, world leaders signed a major new accord Tuesdayin which they pledged to cut carbon emissions to the extent that they could realistically back out of a few years from now. “This agreement sets ambitious goals for reducing our carbon footprint, but not so ambitious that we can’t come up with a plausible-seeming excuse when we inevitably fail to meet its benchmarks,” read a joint statement issued through the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change, in which top officials from the United States, China, Germany, Canada, Russia, and France signaled their support for easily reversible measures to combat global warming. “The time for dramatic pronouncements that can be quickly walked back is now. We have vowed to transition away from fossil fuels and set a deadline far enough in the future that hopefully everyone will forget about it. But if necessary, we are fully committed to rationalizing our inaction in terms the United Nations finds palatable.” At press time, a new report issued by the U.N. had found that half of the parties had already succeeded in reneging on the agreement signed earlier that morning."
472,"ALBANY, NY—Acknowledging the New York governor’s impressive leadership skills, members of the nation’s media praised Andrew Cuomo Monday for his decisive, straight-talking approach to harassing his aides. “His ability to recognize a female staffer and immediately take actions necessary to make her uncomfortable is exactly what you want to see in a leader,” said MSNBC’s Brian Williams, who, along with dozens of other journalists across the country, applauded the governor for getting straight to the point when asking an employee about her sex lifeand acting swiftly and decisively to kiss another aide before she could object. “He not only stepped up to the challenge of making unwanted advances against his colleaguesbut alsomade inappropriate comments about their bodies consistently and doggedly. He even delegated his threats to silence them after they were forced to quit their jobs so he could focus on harassing others, like a true statesman.” At press time, Governor Cuomo was receiving new accolades from the media for dismissing the allegations of harassment as a“misunderstanding”in a bold move that many were calling“presidential.”"
473,"WASHINGTON—Citing the long-standing practice of maintaining boundaries between the classes, Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough asked Democrats to cut a minimum wage increase from their stimulus package Friday due to an obscure rule requiring poor citizens to needlessly suffer. “Raising the minimum wage would violate an 1834 statue put in place to inflict arbitrary pain on the nation’s most vulnerable groups,” said MacDonough, explaining that the rule was used as precedent to stop the 95th Congress from increasing the minimum wage to $2.50 in 1977. “There’s only one interpretation of this rule as it clearly states that providing relief for impoverished Americans is not to be included in any budgetary legislation. These policies exist for a reason. Punishing the lower class is a non-partisan issue. There’s no need to be frustrated with either party—take up your gripes with the Andrew Jackson administration and the 23rd United States Congress.” At press time, the stimulus package was in limbo while the Senate Parliamentarian determined if it was withinthe country’s purview to help the unemployed."
474,"WASHINGTON—Acting in his unofficial role as “consoler-in-chief,” President Joe Biden took some time Friday to comfort the families of those lost in yesterday’s airstrike with an eloquent speech on the challenges of living with heartbreaking loss. “Take it from me, folks, I know just how difficult it is to have those you love most taken from you suddenly and without warning,” said Biden, his voice dropping with obvious emotion as he spoke about the overwhelming power of grief to shape people’s lives. “The world can seem like a cruel place sometimes when a senseless, tragic act like this happens to a family member, but I want you to know, and I hope you can take some solace in this, you will make it through this. The pain and the sorrow never leave, but, in time, you can learn to live with the anguish, and you can learn to embrace those loved ones you have left all the more.” Biden added that his heart broke anew each time he pictured all those who would die from airstrikes in the next four years."

Chris Sprowls of the popular proposal, which had already garnered unanimous support among Republicans in the House and Senate. “Come voting day, voters will be able to walk right up to the doors of their polling place, then turn around. No lines, no worry. We’ve listened to your concerns,and are confident that ballotless voting will address them.” At press time, Sprowls added that the bill would also help fight voter fraud by eliminating the likelihood of votes being erroneously counted."
477,"WASHINGTON—Alleging that residents of his home state were just looking for a handout, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) claimed Wednesday that West Virginians were too deficient in character and grit to deserve a $15 minimum wage. “Frankly, Mountain Staters have never shown the work ethic or drive necessary to merit $15 an hour, so what makes them think they have any right to that kind of money?” said Manchin, who added that he hadn’t gone to Washington to bring home benefits to constituents who lacked the moral fiber, backbone, and talent required to provide for themselves. “If the people of West Virginia want to earn a living wage, they need to pound the pavement until they get a job that pays one. Look at me: I went out there, found work in the U.S. Senate, and became a multimillionaire. So don’t tell me a person can’t work his way up.” Manchin went on to observe that the least West Virginians could do is take enough personal responsibility to vote out the legislators in Charleston who set the state minimum wage at a measly $8.75 per hour."
478,"WASHINGTON—Refusing to back down from the line of questioning in hopes of getting a detailed answer, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly pressed attorney general nominee Merrick Garland Tuesday about his legal philosophy when it came to the issue of seething personal vengeance. “Now, Judge Garland, how would you feel, hypothetically speaking, about the Justice Department using its power to just absolutely wreck the life of someone who may or may not have brazenly wronged you on the public stage, say, oh, I don’t know, five or so years ago?” asked the seven-term Kentucky senator, who spent much of his allotted time at the confirmation hearing inquiring whether the circuit judge prefers to seek recompense immediately or follows the “dish best served cold” school of thought. “You’ve had a long, distinguished career, both as a prosecutor and on the bench, and I guess what I’m most interested to know is how long you think you might be capable of holding a grudge. Would you say your approach to the law has been more ‘eye for an eye’ or ‘live and let live’? And, in your view, do you think it would be appropriate for the attorney general—the nation’s chief law enforcement officer—to exact retribution for a slight that, in all fairness, was not at all personal in nature?” At press time, a visibly nervous McConnell had begun asking Garland about his stance on head starts."
479,"PALM BEACH, FL—Seething over the fact he was no longer in the Oval Office as pandemic casualties reached a new milestone, former President Trump expressed worry Monday that President Biden would take credit for the 500,000 Covid deaths the Trump administration had made possible. “No other president could have pushed death rates that high, and now that bastard is swooping in at the end of this pandemic and stealing my thunder,” said Trump, claiming that without his strategy of discouraging mask use and pretending the virus would go away on its own, the nation would never have been able to make it to a quarter million deaths, let alone a half million. “It wasn’t Biden who spent months refusing to attend the coronavirus task force meetings. That was all me. Case numbers, hospitalizations, deaths—they’ve all been plummeting since I left office.  Clearly, the new guy doesn’t have what it takes, and yet all the crooked news media wants to talk about is Joe Biden. Unbelievable.” At press time, Trump was brimming with pride after hearing a presidential historian on television suggest the plague would be remembered years from now as “Trump’s pandemic.”"

I’ll rent a car and drive the rest of the way. Just get me on a plane, all right?

Did you assholes remember none of it? It’s ‘The former president’s rhetoric is protected under the First Amendment,’ andthenyou do the long, pregnant pause for dramatic effect. Now sell it, you fucking halfwits!” Sources reported that as defense arguments concluded, a visibly tense Graham jumped up from his chair, applauded wildly, and stared daggers into his Republican colleagues until they, too, stood and joined his ovation."

This is awful. We already know where this is leading, which is Chuck Schumer not dying. No one should have to relive that horrible day. The part where he gets to the other side of the door safely makes me sick every time. Honestly, I might throw up.” At press time, Cruz had left the Senate chamber to catch his breath in the rotunda after getting to the part of the footage where the rioters didn’t parade Schumer’s lifeless body around on their shoulders."

As your mayor, I promise you can wrap your lips around this monster hog!” At press time, Yang’s lead had grown even wider after the candidate began humping the camera."
485,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that the proceedings violated clear principles handed down by the Founding Fathers, GOP senators took to the chamber floor in the lead-up to former President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial to argue that it is unconstitutional to be forced to work on a Tuesday. “We would urge our esteemed colleagues to recall that the Bill of Rights was specifically formulated to guarantee our right to kick back and relax on a Tuesday,” said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, urging the immediate postponement of the trial until a date in which all participants had availed themselves of their legallyprotected rights to get their “batteries recharged” through a little quality rest and relaxation. “The Framers’ intent is clear: After a tough Monday, it’s important that Americans can decompress, sleep in, and take a nice little siesta before the midweek slump, The fact that Democrats are choosing to politicize this and drag us in on a beautiful Tuesday is frankly unconscionable.” McConnell went on to ask for an adjournment of the trial after contending that many Democrats had defied crucial precedents forbidding them from speaking to him before he had his coffee."
486,"WASHINGTON—Calling on the U.S. House of Representatives not to do something it might regret, political pundits from several major news outlets warned Thursday that removing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) from her committee assignments would only leave her with more time on her hands. “If she has a lot of free hours in her workday, she’ll wind up using them to spin conspiracy theories, harass the survivors of school shootings, or openly advocate murder on Facebook,” said ABC chief anchor George Stephanopoulos, who echoed the concerns of many observers when he suggested it might be best if the freshman lawmaker and QAnon supporter was kept as busy as possible. “Why leave her twiddling her thumbs when you could put her on a bunch of committees where she’d be overwhelmed by endless hearings and tedious parliamentary maneuvers? Personally, I think it’d be prudent to assign her to the Agriculture, Ethics, Small Business, Foreign Affairs, Homeland Security, and Armed Services committees. Maybe put her on some Senate committees too. Whatever it takes to keep her occupied.” An hour after a House vote was scheduled to remove Greene from her committees, sources confirmed she had already tweeted out a theory that climate change was caused by secret Muslims running extension cords up to the Arctic Circle and placing space heaters near all the biggest glaciers."
487,"WASHINGTON—Vowing to provide the State Department with the funding and resources it required to pursue his administration’s goals, President Joe Biden announced “I want to go see those mountains where it looks likeAvatar” in a speech Thursday outlining his foreign policy agenda. “The foundational principles of the next four years of diplomacy are restoring America’s place as a world leader, and getting to see those floating sky mountains fromAvatarup close,” said Biden, adding that he had already reached out to James Cameron and the location scouts fromAvatarto schedule a meeting in those mountains and improve diplomatic relations with “those big blue cat guys.” “In addition, my administration will not hesitate to pursue America’s interests in wondering how they found all those amazing hobbit hideaways inThe Lord Of The Rings, as well as uncovering all intelligence about how they got bears to play musical instruments at Disney World. Thank you.” Biden also announced that a crucial part of his foreign policy agenda was containing China by ensuring that they didn’t get anywhere near those mountains fromAvatarand “the secret gold or life force or whatever” that they contained inside."
488,"WASHINGTON—Unable to maintain his composure in light of such a tragic situation, Todd Michaels, a lobbyist for Kaiser Permanente, reportedly teared up Tuesday after realizing that Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) no longer recognized his face. “Barely a week has gone by for the last 10years when we haven’t discussed how to make sure Kaiser has a seat at the table, so it’s absolutely devastating seeing her cognitive function dip like this,” said a visibly upset Michaels, confirming that the senator’s repeated references to George W. Bush’s proposed social security privatization had made him realize she was not aware what decade it was anymore. “It’s just so sad. Senator Feinstein has been there for us as long as I can remember, guiding us and helping turn us into the industry we are today, but now she can’t even differentiate me from a lobbyist for Google or Pacific Gas & Electric. The best I can do is hope she has a few lucid minutes a day when I can get her to push through the legislation we need.” At press time, Michaels vowed that despite the difficulty he would remain by Feinstein’s side for years or even decades to come."
489,"WASHINGTON—Telling reporters that someone “may be after her” and that she needed to move fast, a paranoid Janet Yellen reportedly hid the entire U.S. money supply Monday in the Treasury Department’s drop ceiling. Yellen, who had recently been sworn in as Treasury secretary, was last seen sprinting down the hallway to her office,carrying a duffle bag containing over 3 trillion dollars in cashand pointing a loaded Beretta 92FS semi-automatic pistol at anything that made a noise. According to sources, the sweaty, wide-eyed economist then darted into an empty room, propped open a ceiling tile with a broom, and proceeded to throw in as many gold bars, treasury bonds, and coins as she could fit. At press time, Yellen was reportedly spotted replacing the panel, falling off of a rickety chair, and quickly hiding an envelope filled with 200 million dollars in her coat before Joe Biden entered the room."
490,"WASHINGTON—In an attempt to assess the problem from the ground up, transportation secretary nominee Pete Buttigieg told reporters Friday he was learning about the challenges facing the nation’s outdated rail infrastructure by living as a train for a week. “ I’ve spent seven days as a cross-country passenger train, transporting thousands of Americans under my own power so I can better understand the plight of our great railways,” said Buttigieg, who demurred when asked whether President Biden, a well-known Amtrak enthusiast, would be hopping aboard his new Cabinet member for a round-trip express ride from D.C. to Wilmington, DE. “I intend to complete a multiday route between New York and Los Angeles, and while I know it will be tough to hit all the stops on time, I can’t think of a better way to get acquainted with America’s proud but neglected rolling stock, or meet its aging, dilapidated tracks. And when I roll through your town, feel free to climb into my café car, grab a cup of coffee, and share any concerns you have about rail travel.” At press time, reports confirmed the former South Bend, IN mayor had  derailed at 80 mph, leaving 27 passengers dead and another 54 gravely injured."
491,"WASHINGTON—Confirming the monument’s resonance endured a century after its construction, a new report released Monday found that the Lincoln Memorial remained the most powerful testament to the nation’s passion for sitting down. “The Lincoln Memorial stands as a noble and powerful reminder that regardless of color, faith, or creed, taking a load off and plopping down remains one of the country’s foremost ideals,” read the Pew Research Center report in part, which found that over 80% of Americans agreed that the Lincoln Memorial was the nation’s most meaningful symbol of the patriotic belief in taking a seat to rest their tired feet for a minute, with Boston’s statue of John Harvard and Cincinnati’s James Bradley statue a distant second and third. “Americans are a sedentary people, and sitting has long been one of the nation’s most valued and powerful stances. It’s a position that is so ingrained in the American character that President Lincoln sat down right up until he died, a martyr for his cause of remaining seated. The Lincoln Memorial sits as a resolute tribute to our shared beliefs and history.” The report added that Americans continued to disapprove of statues of Confederate generals because although many of them were sitting, they were sitting on horses, and the nation overwhelmingly rejected any memorials that celebrated the lost cause of physical activity."
492,"WASHINGTON—Carrying on breathlessly with no sign of soon stopping, President Joe Biden’s inaugural address spilled over into the second day Thursday as he continued to list the greatest issues facing the nation. “Child poverty, crumbling infrastructure, cyber warfare, wildfires, opioids, domestic violence, hunger, and homelessness plague our nation—not to mention sex trafficking, automation, hurricanes, obesity, and misinformation,” said Biden, who clutched the podium with both hands in exhaustion as his speech to thenation stretched into its 26thhour, continuing to list immigration, unemployment, offshoring, guns, the wage gap, and water contamination as just a few of thousands of challenges waiting on the road ahead. “Gerrymandering, the decline of manufacturing, sexual harassment, and food deserts. Chlamydia, the cost of insulin, water privatization, credit card debt, dog fighting, and teen drinking. High murder rates on indigenous reservations and rising sea levels and smog. Low teacher salaries, E. coli, data breaches, voter suppression, animal testing, and PTSD. Plus, you can’t forget the student loan crisis, lobster overfishing, the structural inequalities of the Senate, home foreclosures, the loneliness epidemic, toddlerdrowning deaths, cyberbullying, and suicide.” At press time, Biden had continued rattling off gang violence, robocalling, and asthma as EMTs transported the dehydrated president into an ambulance."
493,"WASHINGTON—When the life of the newly inaugurated 78-year-old president was threatened Wednesday, Secret Service agent Marshall Cole did not hesitate to dive heroically in front of the strong breeze that could have felled Joe Biden, according to reports from the scene. “I wouldn’t have accepted this detail with the new administration if I weren’t willing to take a moderate gust of wind for the president,” said Cole, who appeared completely unscathed by a direct hit to the chest from a breeze that came within inches of Biden and might have caused the president to lose his balance and fall, potentially breaking a hip or suffering a stroke from which he would never recover. “I felt a gentle wafting of air coming up the West Front of the Capitol, and when I realized it was heading straight for the president, I jumped into action immediately. But I want to stress that I only did what any other member of this agency would have done in my position. We all underwent extensive training beforehand to ensure no stairs, uneven surfaces, damp chills, or prolonged exposures to sunlight would endanger President Biden. Obviously, if a light drizzle had begun to fall, we would have rushed him to a secure location immediately.” At press time, Biden had reportedly been hospitalized after he fell backward and collapsed beneath a medal of valor he was trying to bestow upon Cole for his courageous actions."
494,"WASHINGTON—Moments after the five-piece band capped off a hard bop-inflected rendition of “Hail To The Chief,” the inauguration crowd reportedly politely cheered along Wednesday as Sen. Pat Toomey’s jazz combo played the opening set before the swearing-in of Joe Biden. “Yeah, Toomey’s band definitely isn’t as tight as some of the pro ensembles on the D.C. club scene, but when Mitch McConnell gets a chance to blow on that horn, it’s kind of surprising how well he can wail,”  said D.C. resident Gregory Shaw, pausing to snap along to Pat Toomey’s Quintet as a feather porkpie–bedecked Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) traded off clarinet solos with Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI). “I guess I didn’t need to hear another cover of ‘My Funny Valentine,’ and sure, some of the fusion stuff they’re doing isn’t really up my alley. But they’re clearly really into this stuff. Apparently they practice all the time over in Richard Burr’s basement, so it’s nice that the inaugural team gave them a chance to work on their chops. I just wish they’d stop plugging theirCDs between every song.” At press time, the crowd had started booing after the band abruptly switched gears into a cover of John Coltrane’s free jazz opusKulu Sé Mama."
495,"WASHINGTON—Letting out a loud, slobbery bark as onlookers gasped in horror, a stray Doberman pinscher who put his paw on the inaugural Bible was accidentally sworn in as president of the United States, government officials confirmed Wednesday. The 98-pound short-haired canine, who bounded up the stage and sprinted straight past Secret Service, reportedly knocked over President-elect Joe Biden, licked his face, and then placed his right front paw directly onto the leather-bound volume at the exact moment Chief Justice John Roberts began to recite the oath of office. According to sources, the scene that followed was one of great confusion, with aides informing a visibly dumbfounded Joe and Jill Biden that the Doberman, which clawed several pages out of the family’s heirloom Bible and then proceeded to lick his own groin, would begin his term immediately and serve for the next four years. A White House spokesperson later told reporters that Ace, the nation’s 46th commander-in-chief, would soon take his first trip as president, a visit to Texas during which he is expected to urinate on the border wall."
496,"WASHINGTON—Warning the crew to be very careful while transporting his valuables outside the White House, Donald Trump reportedly directed movers Wednesday to load a bubble-wrapped Melania into a storage pod. “Allright, everything here that I’ve marked with a Sharpie comes with me, and everything else, including the first lady, goes into a warehouse for storage,” said Trump,as he surveyed dozens of cardboard boxes labeled “kitchen,” “family room,” and “bedroom” before pausing to write the word “FRAGILE” across his wife’s face. “Don’t get me wrong, Melania’s looked great the last four years, but I wouldn’t exactly call her a top-priority item for my new place. Seriously though, if you put even the smallest scratch anywhere on her body, I’ll come after you for all your worth. That’s a rare and expensive Slovenian piece that’s extremely difficult to replace, and I’m more than prepared to sue you for damages.” At press time, Trump was cussing out several movers after they forgot to secure the first lady inside the vehicle, only to open the door and find her crushed beneath a couch."
497,"WASHINGTON—Unable to pinpoint the exact time the new administration takes over, the United States reportedly entered a constitutional crisis Wednesdayafter officials forgot whether the transfer of presidential power happens at 12:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m. “Shit, shit, shit, do we have Biden take over at midnight or does it happen over lunchtime?” said Anita Dunn, senior advisor to the President-elect, as the fate of the nation’s democracy hung in the balance while teams of stumped constitutional scholars struggled to discern whether Biden’s term legitimately starts when he puts his hand on the Bibleor when “Hail To The Chief” plays. “P.M. means postmeridian, so it seems like it has to do with the placement of the sun, but then—fuck—how do we factor in time zone differences? Do we need to appoint an acting president for a few hours or something, or does the House speaker need to hit their gavel in a special way? I’m completely lost.” At press time, transition officials decided to just go with whatever the hell it said on Wikipedia."
498,"WASHINGTON—Feeling agitated and desperate with less than 24 hours on the clock, President Donald Trump was reportedly panicking Tuesday after realizing his fingerprints were all over the White House. “Oh God, I touched everything—there’s no way we have time to get this whole place cleaned,” said Trump, who emptied a bottle of bleach over the Resolute desk as he and a team of aides worked frantically to scrub everysurface, doorknob, and square inch of the building of evidence the president was ever there. “Geez, what was I thinking? This is such a rookie mistake. I should have been wearing gloves these past four years. Oh God, and there are cameras too, aren’t there?  Someone get Roger Stone over here. Maybe it’d be easier to just burn the whole place down.” At press time, Trump was carefully planting a couple of Melania’s hairs in the Oval Office."
499,"WASHINGTON—Following her brief suspension from the social media platform, Rep. Lauren Boebert  (R-CO) continued to livetweet House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s location Friday, posting “She’s now eating a muffin in the commissary.” “The Speaker has discarded the baking cup and is now pouring herself a cup of coffee—no, she’s going for tea,” reported Boebert, who shared minute-by-minute updates on Pelosi’s current whereabouts with her hundreds of thousands of right-wing followers, along with a series of blurry photos of the House speaker rummaging through a drawer for sweetener. “The Speaker has selected Splenda. Interesting, she usually goes forSweet’N Low. She’s flicking the packet now. Oh, we’re on the move! The Speaker is walking down the hallway. We’re going fast now, I’d say five, six miles per hour. Update: the Speaker has broken a heel. She’s entered the bathroom! I repeat, the Speaker has entered the bathroom, and has barricaded herself inside a stall.” At press time, Boebert was standing on the toilet in the adjacent stall, attempting to clamber her way over the top."
500,"MALIBU, CA—Rushing to his home after hearing news of the conservative mega-donor’s passing, hundreds of GOP legislatorsreportedly crowded into a sitting room Tuesday for the reading of Sheldon Adelson’s will. “I was really distraught to hear about Mr. Adelson’s passing, but I also wonder what he’ll have left to me—after so many years of working for him, I think it’s the least he could do,” said Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), jostling for space with fellow Republican senators Mitch McConnell, Ted Cruz, Susan Collins, Rick Scott, Thom Tillis, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, President Donald Trump, and dozens of GOP representatives who had worked for the deceased business magnate over the years. “Of course, I’m hoping for one of Mr. Adelson’s Super PACs, but I’d settle for a few million dollars. I just hope he remembered all the good I’ve done for him and how faithfully I’ve executed his vision over the years, and doesn’t get swayed by some of these johnny-come-lately Republicans who only started working for him in his final years. I think there’s enough to go around, but I hope they read it quickly before more people get here and it starts getting contentious—oh, great, [Israeli prime minister Benjamin] Netanyahu just showed up.” At press time, Cornyn was trying to hide his frustration after the executor announced Adelson had willed him Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign."
501,"WASHINGTON—Insisting the billionaire’s demise would have a chilling effect on democracy, conservatives accused nature Tuesday of silencing right-wing voices after GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson died at 87. “It’s disgusting and frankly un-Americanthat nature decided it had the right to unilaterally end Sheldon Adelson’s existence after nearly ninedecades of being alive,” said Republican Congressman Jim Jordan, who,along with others in his party,promised to bring an investigation against the concept of time for its role in abruptly stifling the casino magnate just days after Trump supporters rioted inside the Capitol. “Tell me, why is Ronald Reagan dead but Jimmy Carter still alive? I’ll tell you, it’s anti-conservative bias. The Declaration of Independence guarantees every American the right to life, andI’m not going to sit idly by while the laws of biology muzzle great patriots like Mr. Adelson. People dying of old age is what happens in China or Nazi Germany, not the greatU.S. of A.” At press time, right-wing leaders were urging fellow Republicans to boycott nature by setting fire to their lawns."
502,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concerns that the country’s emotional state might be incapable of handling the news right now, reluctant Democrats in Washington confirmed Tuesday that they are holding off on revealing that President-Elect Joe Biden died from a heart attack six days ago. “It’s obviously very sad, but it just felt like it would be super awkward to throw this out there while everyone is already so on edge,” said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who admitted that while the death of the recently elected Biden creates serious problems around keeping the country functioning and tackling the Covid-19 crisis, he did not want to kick the American people while they were already down. “I know we should have announced it immediately,  but we hesitated, and pretty soon the Capitol was being stormed, and things have been super crazy ever since. Hopefully, we can make it to the inauguration before people start asking questions. We just have a lot on our plate right now, and honestly, this is the last thing we want to deal with.” At press time, Schumer was ruminating on whether he should at least tell Biden’s family."
503,"WASHINGTON—Returning to the legislative chamber mere days after violentlyforcing his way inside with thousands of fellow insurrectionists, 37-year-old Trump rioter Joshua McSherry reportedly knocked on the Senate door Monday to ask about retrieving the set of car keys he had left behind while storming the U.S. Capitol building. “Hey, this is super embarrassing, but has anyone seen a key to a Ford Escape around here?” said McSherry, who gingerly poked his head into the room and mouthed the word “sorry” before edging to the front of the chamber to check for the missing keys under the dais. “I’m not interrupting, am I? I was just here last week smashing some windows in—I don’t know if you remember. I already checked some of the offices, but they weren’t there. Anyway, they’re on a Mickey Mouse lanyard if that helps. Also, does somebody here know where I can find Ilhan Omar? No reason, just asking.” At press time, several Republican senators were crawling around on their hands and knees to assist McSherry in his search."
504,"WASHINGTON—In response to calls for urgent action against the president following the storming of the Capitol by an angry mob, scrambling congressional Democrats  announced Friday that they were prepared to start impeachment hearings by April. “American democracy is at stake, which is why we’ve  convened an investigatory committee with the goal to begin impeachment proceedings against the president of the United States by late April—or May at the very latest,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, adding that Democrats were working day and night to gather evidence after becoming convinced that there was no other option to help the country heal but voting to impeach the sitting president in the spring. “Once we return from our January hiatus, it will be full steam ahead—accounting for our February and March breaks, of course. In fact, to focus our full attention on this effort, we’re also shelving all other legislative plans until summer to devote our full attention to this impeachment effort: No stimulus. No infrastructure. President Trump must go.” Reached for comment, Sen. Mitch McConnell agreed that enough was enough and  Senate Republicans were prepared to ratify the impeachment of the sitting president by July."
505,"WASHINGTON—Describing the move as a grave political misstep that would  damage the party’s brand for generations to come, Rep.Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) berated progressive Democrats Monday for electing such a dangerously polarizing house speaker. “While I commend the speaker for her narrow victory, I cannot ignore the progressives who voted to put her in power, and in doing so, endangered the Democratic majority,” said the 17-term congresswoman, adding that elected officials such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar had been needlessly reckless in their choice to elevate the outspoken and controversial majority leader into the national spotlight. “Once again, the left has chosen optics over successful governing. Maybe it’s fine for those of you in safe seats to grandstand with your votes, but when the Republicans win in two years, there will be blood on your hands.” At press time, Pelosi vowed to do everything in her power to make sure the House Speaker faced nothing but roadblocks during the next two years."
506,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that he could no longer balance the duties of both roles simultaneously, William Barr announced plans Tuesday to step down as attorney general to pursue his true passion full-time as the “K-Street Strangler.” “Today, I would like to inform you that I will be departing my post on December 23rd in order to devote more time to following my true calling of lurking in the streets of D.C., murdering unsuspecting pedestrians in cold blood,” said Barr at a press conference, revealing that he’s been moonlighting as the infamous serial killer since the 1980s and would like to commit his full energy to the project. “As it stands, it has become very difficult to work a full day at the Justice Department and still have anything left in the tank to spend the evening preying on unsuspecting sex workers in impoverished minority neighborhoods. I finally have a little nest egg, so I can do what I love and fully pursue my dream of creating notoriety for myself in the press by terrorizing D.C. residents.” At press time, President Trump expressed that he was sad to see Barr go, but understood his colleague’s desire and wished him the best of luck in his endeavor."
507,"Thank you for bravely standing up to the American voters. It is an honor to witness such valor. Bravo for confronting the sick and twisted sycophants who would attempt to select the candidate of their choice. Sir, you have served your country well, fighting against the scourge of Democracy as well as the menace of exposing sexual abuse. It takes true grit to defy those who would dare to cast a ballot. Please never back down from your constituents. We The People applaud you for confronting We The People. Thank you for protecting us from liberalism. We are blessed to have you working tirelessly to throw out the votes of Michigan residents. We need you to help destroy the U.S. Constitution next. You have been absolutely fearless when stopping the American people from participating in elections. You now stand shoulder to shoulder with many of the Confederate leaders. The American people will never forget your bravery. You’re inspiring millions of children to never accept election results. If more people had your spine, the entire country would be like Alabama. Tears are rolling down our faces, Mr. Congressman! Thank you for selflessly bringing to light the dangers of federalism. Never again will we allow U.S. citizens to recklessly turn in their ballots. Sure looks like heroes are just bigger in Texas. We know you’ll never stop fighting things like all 50 states certifying their election results. From sea to shining sea, we shall throw out votes. Real patriotism is challenging the American people when they vote wrong. More treading on the will of the people please. Sir,the founding fathers are bursting from their graves to tell you how proud they are. God hates American voters, too. You’re in good company. Liberty is about our rights to question whether some people’s votes should count. We applaud your eternal vigilance against people who selected a candidate you don’t like. Never apologize for being an American who disenfranchises voters. You have performed your duty to protect our elections from U.S. citizens. Way to stand firm against voters from other states. Man is not free unless democracy is limited. Thank you for protecting us from the horrors of the ballot box. We are never defeated unless we count every single vote. We appreciate the things you do to marginalize voters. So blessed to have such courage in Congress. We are praying for your safety while disenfranchising millions of voters. Thank you for sacrificing your ethics. You have fulfilled your duty. We will never fear the American voter again. We appreciate how you’ve protected our right to suppress the vote. Thank you for smacking democracy right in the face. There’s nothing more noble than defending your country from representative government. America will never be destroyed without your help. You are the bravest among us. We must all work together to stand up to the oppression of government by the people. Keep on crushing the aspirations of the human spirit. Let freedom ring for some of the people. Proud of the way you stand for liberty, freedom, and independence from voters. Your bravery singlehandedly caused an entire nest of bald eagles to cry. Thank you for fighting for voter suppression. It takes a village to disenfranchise voters. Thank you for protecting the American people from their bad decisions at the polls. You deserve a medal for speaking truth to sovereign power. Not to be picky, but there’s still a lot of other cornerstones of democracy that you could be quashing. FYI, it’s still cool to stop U.S. citizens from voting. Thank you for helping tyranny gain a foothold. Freedom costs nothing if we don’t bother having it. In the face of impossible odds, you did everything you could to overturn an election. Your boldness is greatly appreciated. You have served your country well while rejecting the will of the American people. We appreciate your commitment to destroying the basic tenets of Western democratic rules. The bravery you displayed while eroding democracy will never be forgotten. Your tireless work to undermine democracy is incredibly selfless and kind. Thanks for not backing down from those who would want a free and fair election. You’ve displayed great courage while standing for un-American ideals. You have been fearless in the face of those who make a formal choice of a candidate. You’ve done so much to improve the diversity of voter suppression. The truest freedom is throwing out election results. You proudly stood up to an unhinged cult selfishly demanding that their votes count. Thank you for pulverizing the values that a bunch of idiots hold sacred. So proud of the way you bravely kicked the underdog. The people of Pennsylvania are lucky to have you protecting them from democracy. Keep up the good work and you’ll be so much closer to permanently ending civil liberties. You’ve done a great job defending liberty from the residents of Michigan. Soon every state will have the opportunity to achieve the same greatness as West Virginia. Your determination to stop democracy is highly admirable. Tyranny would like to give you a great big hug. Thank you for helping to cut back on the legitimacy of our institutions. The life of the nation is secure only when certain groups of people are disenfranchised. You’ve done great work while putting a stop to rampant freedom. You are incredibly brave to confront the desires of constituents. Wow, you inspire us to stand for the flag and kneel before you, good sir. A hero understands the responsibility of that comes with limiting others’ freedom. You’ve really done so much to help modernize voter suppression. Kudos for chipping away at the legitimate foundation of the government. We are in awe of how you so bravely displayed your weakness and cruelty. The American people owe you so much. The world is changed by your awful example not your awful opinion. The only thing you should fear is people making choices at the ballot box. If you didn’t act, many Americans would think that they could get away with voting. You were valiant in the fight against representative democracy. Thank you for your sacrifices in the battle against individual rights. It takes real guts to stand up to doing what’s right. You’ve done great work against democracy, but there’s still more to be done to put an end to civil society. Brave sir, this country doesn’t deserve the likes of you. You have been dauntless while making unsubstantiated claims about the election outcome. It takes real teamwork to destroy the faith of the voting public. Thank you for boldly confronting oppressive voters. So proud of the way you amplified deranged claims. This country might start to function normally if it wasn’t for lionhearted folks like you. You’ve been so gracious while refusing to accept election results. You are a true hero. Have you seen some of the shitheads the American people vote for? America will forever be in your debt for exposing massive amounts of voting. God Bless Some Of America. Real patriotism is challenging a bunch of dumb voters. We need to bring the troops home to protect us from the electorate. Thank you for standing up for politicians, liars, and traitors. You are leading the way in a hard-won victory over Americans."
508,"WILLIAMSPORT, PA—Informing the judge that he had definitive proof of voter fraud against Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani  reportedly announced Thursday in court “Your honor, I’m ready to present” as he pulled a rotted melon and a stray cat out of an old burlap sack. “Give me a second and I’ll show you hard evidence that there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of mail-ballot irregularities, it’s somewhere in here under all these pizzas and teeth,” said the president’s lawyer, rummaging through a large, stained canvas bag, discarding multiple grease-coated catalogs, dozens of half-eaten chicken tenders, and a mason jar containing a murky brown liquid, then holding up what he believed to be damning reports that turned out to be a soaking-wet tarp. “Hang on, your honor. As you’ll soon see, there are all kinds of testimonies and other documents proving definitively that officials knowingly engaged in—no, not this, how did this bath towel get in here? Whose bath towel is this? Objection! Now listen, judge your honor, it’s as clear as the evidence that I’ve written on the back of these cheeseburger wrappers, which if the ketchup writing wasn’t so smeared would clearly evidence fraud to the jury. No matter, though, because I’m smart and I made careful backup ketchup copies of the fraud on some gloves, which are legally admissible in court, as soon as I find them. Just a moment. Now where are my potato peels? Sirs of the jury, I submit here for legal questioning and subsequent arrest and execution whichever culprit took my potato peels. I have probable cause! Those are top-secret pieces of information that have client-attorney permission. Do not look at the potato peels! If the potato peels have been stolen, well that’s witness tampering right there, which means that Trump’s case is automatically won on the grounds of appellate dismissal. That’s all very legal. But first I submit these hockey pucks, and if you ignore the bite marks, it’s unmistakable that they—wait, excuse me, these are the wrong hockey pucks. Objection! The election is a fraud and I have the plastic bags of wet leaves to prove it!” At press time, Giuliani had confidently stated “No further questions, I rest my case” and sat chewing the melon rinds, spitting the seeds onto the prosecution’s table."
509,"WASHINGTON—Casting an eye towards the next presidential election, Republican party leaders had reportedly begun a search Tuesday for a new prissy little shithead who would be able to compete against Trump in 2024. “We’ve obviously had a wonderful relationship with President Trump, but we feel our interests may best be served by a different whining, prim fuckface to lead the party forward,” said RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, confirming that the GOP would be looking at figures from politics, media, and law enforcement in an effort to find a candidate with the right mix of froufrou aesthetics and raging assholishness to build on and expand Trump’s base. “We expect this to be an exhaustive process, as the most obvious prissy little shitheads such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have not caught on with the American public as we had hoped, though fortunately, we have thousands of effete fuckwads who are clamoring for the position. Whoever we finally select, voters can rest assured it will be a little fancy man absolutely ravaged by insecurity and self-loathing.” At press time, McDaniel added that if they could not find such a person, equipping Donald Trump with a different messaging strategy could make him a great candidate for 2024."
510,"LANSING, MI—In an effort to take decisive action against the rapid spread of the coronavirus, governors across the country called on Michigan governorGretchen Whitmer this week to shut down their states this week so their residents won’t get mad at them. “It is long overduethat we buckle downand urge Gretchen to really do us a solid and tell our constituents that she would be instituting an across-the-board shutdown because, frankly, we’re scared of what they might do to us,” said Arizona governor Doug Ducey, echoing the statements from dozens of public officials across the political spectrum who urged Whitmer to stop tiptoeing around the issue and simply face the wrath of residents of Alaska, Idaho, Minnesota, and many more states after she advised them to avoid large gatherings and shelter in place for the foreseeable future. “We need to see real leadership from Governor Whitmer: She must tell our constituents in no uncertain terms that she will be restricting their liberties in order to fight this deadly virusand that we, their governors, had no part in making these decisions, so they should direct any of their hatred or violence toward the Michigan governor’s mansion. It’s just common sense. Besides, most of these people already hate her, so what’s there to worry about?” The governors also stressed that it would also really help them out if she told their state’sprotestersand police departments to chill out, too."

512,"WASHINGTON—Confirming  the vice president was already “testing the waters,” Beltway insiders reported Friday that Mike Pence had created an exploratory committee to find another candidate more charismatic than himself whom he could serve as running mate in 2024. “Mike Pence hopes to win office in four years by joining the ticket of someone who actually displays a discernible personality of some kind,” said exploratory committee co-chair James Conroy, adding that he had  begun surveying potential candidates who possessed any degree of personal magnetism—any at all—and thus might propel Pence back to the vice presidency. “Right now, we’re poring over the data to ensure the vice president makes a good decision about whose coattails he should ride going forward. As in 2016, there won’t be any litmus test based on ideology or character, so long as Mr. Pence is able to hold a prestigious position while doing little more than remaining silent and nodding from time to time. He doesn’t even care if it’s a Republican or a Democrat. He might have some trouble if it were a woman, but at the end of the day, he’s a seasoned VP ready to be unswervingly loyal to anyone who can win the White House.” At press time, Conroy stated that within 24 hours of its formation, the exploratory committee had successfully identified over 320 million Americans with more charisma than Mike Pence."
513,"WASHINGTON—In a 5-4 decision that shocked legal experts across the nation, the Supreme Court made waves Thursday when it struck down former president Barack Obama’s personal health insurance policy. “The court holds that Barack Obama’s use of an HMO to provide health coverage for himself, his wife Michelle, and his daughters Sasha and Malia, is in blatant violation of the Ninth Amendment,” said Chief Justice Roberts, who added that existing coverage for all other Americans would remain unaffectedexcept for the former president and the first family. “Henceforth, all African American men who were the 44th president of the United States will be stripped of coverage, including medical, prescription, and dental. Congress has no authority to reinstate these plans, or allow Barack Obama to purchase health insurance through a PPO, EPO, POS, or other means.” At press time, dissenting Justice Sotomayor protested, adding that such a precedent could open the doors to allowing the Supreme Court to strip39th U.S. president Jimmy Carterof his personal health insurance."
514,"BURNSVILLE, NC—As they adjusted to the dramatic shift in messaging, followers of right-wing conspiracy group QAnon were reportedly frustrated Friday after their anonymous leader, known only as “Q,” called for them to respect the election results and unite behind president-elect Joe Biden. “In his latest post, Q told us we must all come together under a Biden presidency in order to heal the nation, and while that may be a nice sentiment, I’m not sure if he wants us to just set aside all the stuff we believe about Democrats or what,” said local QAnon adherent Jeff White, who expressed the confusion plaguing many in his group when he asked how he was supposed to put his respect for the democratic process above his conviction that Biden belonged to a party of devil-worshipping, child-molesting cannibals. “Q’s saying that whether you’re a red-pilled freedom fighter who serves the Lord or a pedophile who drinks the blood of infants, we’re all Americans at the end of the day. In other words, sure, Joe Biden is enabling homicidal Satanists, but he’s still the person voters have chosen as their president, and you have to respect him.” “That may sound a little crazy, but maybe Q’s right,” he continued. “Maybe if we want to make this country a better place, we have to find common ground with people who don’t necessarily share our views on the need to bring about ‘the Storm’ and stop global elites from consuming the flesh of children they traffic for sex. Look, I’m not a Biden fan, but I did notice Hillary never campaigned for him—that means there’s a good chance he had her executed, which would be a promising development for our cause.” According to sources, most QAnon fellows were disappointed President Trump had lost reelection, but were holding out hope that John F. Kennedy Jr. would soon land his plane in Wilmington, DE and agree to head up Biden’s transition team."
515,"WASHINGTON—Bucking centuries of precedent with a decision not to participate in the peaceful transfer of his authority, Donald Trump Jr. has refused to step down from his post as the president’s oldest son, sources confirmed Wednesday. “I, Don Trump Jr.—or, I should now say, Don Biden Jr.—will continue to fulfill my duties as the president’s eldest male offspring regardless of any attempts to unseat me or render my position illegitimate,” the 42-year-old real estate heir told reporters, saying he looked forward to promoting president-elect Joe Biden’s personal brand and to spending holidays with the first family, during which he hoped to bond with his “new siblings” Hunter and Ashley. “In this tumultuous time, the nation needs continuity, and through my proven experience as the president’s first male issue, I can provide that. Let me be clear: I am the commander-in-chief’s very special boy, and I will continue in this role for four more years. I’ve already filed a lawsuit to halt the installation of any other person in my position and, if necessary, will pursue this matter all the way to the Supreme Court.” At press time, the U.S. Supreme Court had issued a summary judgment declaring that the last person to claim the post of president’s oldest son had never officially stepped down, and thus the role still rightfully belonged to George W. Bush."
516,"WASHINGTON—Following news that the Democratic nominee had officially cleared 270 electoral votes, The Lincoln Project super PAC immediately released a series of ads Friday calling for Joe Biden to be impeached. “It’s time for America to heal, and we can’t do it with this maniac in office,” said the commercial’s narrator, which aired on TV channels across the country alongside an animated ad depicting a mustachioed Biden rapping under the name “Joe Stalin.” “In the 2020 election, we voted for Biden. Now, we understand that was a grave mistake, and it’s our job to turn things around. Joseph Biden must go. The president-elect is out of control. He’s a risk to American democracy, and he’s certainly no conservative.” At press time, The Lincoln Project had unleashed a new campaign tearing into itself for such appalling hypocrisy."
517,"CHICAGO—Seconds after the room had erupted into cheers, applause, and a few big sighs of relief, sources confirmed Tuesday that a local group of friend’s jubilant reaction to Donald Trump’s defeat had soured quickly upon the announcement of Joe Biden’s victory. “One moment we’re celebrating our nation’s repudiation of Trump, and the next Biden is declared the winner—what a buzzkill,” said 29-year-old Ryan Lopez, whose smile had visibly faded to weariness as the former vice president and retired six-term senator appeared on television to celebrate with his family. “The American people just ousted a transparently racist, misogynistic, and authoritarian president, but before we even have a chance to savor that triumph, we’re forced to deal with the fact that his replacement will be Joe Biden. Ugh, why does the single best piece of news this country has had in years have to be taintedimmediately? For fuck’s sake.” At press time, Lopez had reportedly demanded the television be shut off after a news anchor observed that Trump would remain in power until January."

But now I can see my trust was misplaced. I can’t believe I  put faith in your obedience. You’re weak—all of you, weak.” At press time, Trump slowly headed for the exit, treading over the mass of still, silent bodies on the floor with a crunch."

And of course, above all else, I’d like to thank my family and U2, who were very expensive to book and fly in privately so be sure to check them out after the Blue Angels show.” At press time, McGrath had peeled away from the blowout in a brand-new yellow Bugatti as $2 million worth of fireworks spelling out ‘Resist!’ exploded in the sky."
521,"WASHINGTON—Describing the previous night’s results as a shocking transformation in their understanding of the electorate, political analysts told reporters Wednesday night that the 2020 election represented a fundamental realignment in which voting demographics should be demonized. “Frankly, these results reveal nothing less than a massive seachange of who political parties blame for all of this nation’s problems,” said Stanford University polling expert Harry Mills, noting the Republican Party’s historic steps towards creating a diverse multiracial coalition would have repercussions for decades to come in how it alters theunderstanding of electoral scapegoats. “Of course, liberal politicians have been edging toward blaming Cubans and Jewish Americans for their problems for years. But no one ever expected they would be able to vilify them so quickly—and certainly not alongside such a broad assortment of minority strawmenlikeBlack men and homosexuals. Where once it was common sense that Democrats only needed to say non-college-educated whites were bigots voting against their own self-interest, it now seems they’ll also need to pin electoral failures on Hispanics who refuse to use the term Latinx. It’s a stunning development.” At press time, the Democratic Party had used preliminary analysesof the election’s outcome to draft a series of outcomes telling Latinos how badly they had botched the election for the rest of us."

Let’s have that shit ready to iron on the map as soon as it’s decided. And let’s use some scraps of that adorable polka dot fabric Ellen brought in to appliqué a question mark on North Carolina so that Mr. Tapper will have something to point to when he announces it’s still too close to call.

Sign me up if it means I could finally find out who won this damn thing. Feed me propaganda, shoot dissidents in the street, do away with elections altogether, I don’t care!

528,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that they were under a tight deadline, Senate Republicans told reporters Monday they were rushing to confirm six more Supreme Court justices before the election. “We’ve been moving so fast with the Amy Coney Barrett confirmation because there are six more sets of hearings and votes we want to finish within the next week,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, noting that Republicans wanted to make sure, while they still held power to sidestep any Democrat complaints, that they curated a diverse selection of nuanced conservative opinions on the court to rule for the next few decades. “We’re already planning to double up on a couple of the hearings by simultaneously questioning a judge from Virginia with two months of experience and some other judge I’ve never heard of but who’s already been vetted by the Federalist Society. Hopefully, all six are confirmed and sitting on the bench before the American people have their say at the polls.” At press time, all six conservative justices had been confirmed to the Supreme Court and Republican senators had announced they were going to try to fit in 10 more spontaneous confirmations before  election day."

530,"WASHINGTON—Blaming the chronic lack of resources for hampering his ability to run the agency the way he wanted, Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie told reporters Monday that he was struggling to profit off of his underfunded department. “When I took this job, I really didn’t expect that there would be so little funding going to veteran care that it’s basically impossible to skim millions of dollars off the top,” said Wilkie, adding that he left a lucrative position in the private sector because he believed that working in the Veterans Affairs department would allow him to rake in some quick cash for himself and his friends. “Frankly, I was just going to slash funding for healthcare and community care and redirect that money into outrageously overpriced consulting gigs, but Congress has spent so many years depriving veterans of funding that there’s basically nothing left to gut. As it is, I can barely cobble together the cash for a single private jet ride—and that’s only going one way. When I talk to other Trump appointees like [Education Secretary] Betsy DeVos and [Transportation Secretary] Elaine Chao and hear about the easy money they get from their golden-goose agencies, I can’t help but wonder why our government is okay with leaving the leaders of the Veterans Committee out in the cold.” Wilkie also expressed concerns that he hadn’t made it clear enough in previous budget requests that none of the money would be actually going to veterans."

It’s true that we hoped to get the puzzle done faster when we started in June, but even working on it day and night, it takes time to assemble so many pieces. There are still some sticking points, like whether a few of the border pieces are lost for good or whether they’re just in a couch cushion somewhere in the Oval Office, but as soon as we find those and finish the cypress tree, we’ll be all ready to present it to the public.” Pelosi and Mnuchin admitted that it still might be hard to reach an agreement with Senate Republicans, who so far had rejected the offers of doing a puzzle entirely and seemed unlikely to agree to anything except a game of Risk."

So tomorrow, or maybe the next day, I just might decide to tweet out a video of what happened here tonight so everyone will know what the fake news is doing with all these nasty questions.

I’m sorry, sir, but that’s where we’re at.” The Democratic candidate concluded the evening with a stirring warning that Trump’s lack of composure only helped show more than ever why a Biden cabinet would instead be stocked with honest Americans like William Barr and Rudolph Giuliani."

I’ve also shared this with the FBI so they can authenticate it.

But there’s no getting around the fact that the economy is hurting, and the best way to help is by mandating that all Americans send money to senators and the Pentagon directly. This was also a bipartisan effort, a compromise reached after Democrats wanted you to send $1,600 and Republicans wanted you to send $1,200. We hope that during this difficult time, all Americans will appreciate that extra $1,200 out of their pocketbooks and into our hands.” The stimulus bill also reportedly includes significant provisions targeted at helping small businesses close."

556,"WASHINGTON—Mere hours after the closure of the first 2020 presidential debate, an Onion-Zweibel Poll released Wednesday found that the vast majority of viewers agree America was a complete waste of time. “In the wake of the contentious clash between former Vice President Biden and President Donald Trump, we’re seeing nearly 63% of debate viewers expressing their strong feelings that the United States of America never should have happened in the first place,” said chief pollster Dr. Elias Ross, explaining that when discussing the existence of America, 53% of those surveyed described themselves as “annoyed” or “infuriated,” while 17% thought the country was a total waste of the past 243 years, and only 1% asserted that they continued to have neutral or positive feelings toward the nation. “Meanwhile, a plurality of our sample believe that we should take the unprecedented step of simply canceling America from here on out, saying that it contributed nothing of substance to their lives and actually made their outlook for the future substantially worse. Overall, these are very low numbers for America at this stage in the republic. Frankly, I can’t see how the country turns things around.” Ross added that one survey participant after viewing the 90-minute debate had even gone so far as to call Thomas Jefferson “unhinged” and “behaving like a crackhead” for ever putting forth the idea of representative democracy."

558,"CLEVELAND—Letting out a forced gasp at the phony mugging, President Donald Trump stoked fears surrounding crime Tuesday by having Secretary of State Mike Pompeo disguise himself as a cat burglar and rob him on the debate stage. “Oh no, look, it’s a violent Antifa thug sent here by Joe Biden to rob me!” said Trump, exclaiming that these types of thefts would happen more and more if liberals raise taxes while a black-clad Pompeo stuffed the president’s wallet into a sack emblazoned with a dollar sign. “Yikes! I want to call the cops on this very, very bad guy, but there aren’t any police around because Black Lives Matter got rid of them! I should never have come to this Democrat-run city!” At press time, William Barr came out disguised as a doctor to treat Trump’s injuries and then charged him $50,000, explaining that the high price tag was due to the exorbitant insurance premiums caused by the ACA."
559,"WASHINGTON—Accusing their Democratic opponents of using coded language to stir up prejudice among the electorate, Republicans argued Monday that references to Amy Coney Barrett as “Trump’s court pick” carried deeply anti-Catholic undertones. “To attack Judge Barrett’s faith by calling her ‘President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court’ is to engage in a long and shameful tradition of thinly veiled insults aimed at Catholics,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, adding that 19th-century Irish and Italian immigrants to the United States could hardly have been met with an epithet as hateful as “Donald Trump’s choice to fill the vacancy left by the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.” “For Americans who adhere to the teachings of Catholicism, painful memories are conjured up each time someone says a person is ‘almost certain to be confirmed to the highest court in the land by a slim majority of Republicans.’ We have freedom of religion in this country, and to hear Democrats resort to such anti-Catholic dog whistles is frankly disgusting.” At press time, McConnell asserted that his critics on the left wouldn’t have disparaged Barrett’s faith if she were a “filthy Muslim.”"
560,"WILMINGTON, DE—In an effort to improve outreach ahead of the upcoming presidential election, the Joe Biden campaign announced Monday that it was removing “defeating Trump” from its platform to avoid alienating swing voters. “This election is a time when we all need to come together, not cause divisiveness by focusing on trying to oust a candidate who millions of Americans support,” said Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, announcing that he was removing all mention of trying to beat the incumbent Republican president from his campaign website and subsequent speeches. “How is making ‘defeat Trump’ a central part of my campaign platform going to play with Trump supporters? Trump voters are a huge constituency, especially in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and it’s going to be tough to win them over if we keep alienating them with our rhetoric. We want a broad coalition here, which includes Trump supporters, and so going forward we’re eliminating any negative remarks about Donald Trump in campaign ads and speeches. It’s time to take a stand and say that defeating Trump is simply not what the Biden campaign stands for.” Reports from the Biden campaign also indicated that strategists were gaming out how many swing-state Trump supporters they would win over if they formally endorsed the president’s reelection."

562,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to boost campaign contributions before election day, Tom Perez warned Friday that he will detonate his explosive vest at midnight unless Democrats meet their fundraising goal. “As the election quickly approaches, we urge our supporters to please act quickly to ensure that I don’t blow myself up in a crowded public place,” said the DNC chair, explaining that even a small donation of $5 or $10 would go a long way toward preventing hundreds of lives being senselessly lost in a preventable suicide bombing. “Without your monetary support, Biden and vulnerable Democratic senators are at risk of being turned to a smoldering pile of ash and bone.” At press time, Perez’s threat to kill himself if the goal was not met had caused DNC donations to drop significantly."
563,"WASHINGTON—Declaring that the party’s rhetoric around the upcoming election was way out of line, Fox News pundits  slammed Democrats Fridayfor repeatedly attempting to undermine confidence in the nation’s autocratic system. “Anyone questioning what President Trump will do on election night or afterwards is participating in a very dangerous effort to get Americans to mistrust the basic tenets of this country’s autocracy,” said  Sean Hannity on his broadcast, sharply criticizing Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and other Democratic leaders for inferring that their party would attempt to subvert bedrocks of American autocracy like the supreme executive leader and the peaceful consolidation of power. “The Democrats’ rhetoric is exactly why so many people in this country feel like they can’t even trust the autocratic system. The entire one-party system we live under will disintegrate before our eyes if people lose faith in the process. Fortunately, the autocratic process in this country is very strong, so it’ll take more than a few critical words to destroy it, but what they’re doing is flagrant and dangerous. Our country is an autocracy, okay? It just is. If you don’t like it, you can go to Scandinavia.” At press time, the Democrats responded that they refused to let Trump and the Republicans try to ruin the future of the nation’s plutocracy."
564,"WASHINGTON—Frantically scouring textbooks to find sections in need of revision, members of President Donald Trump’s new patriotic 1776 Commission struggled Wednesday to find ways to improve upon the education system’s existing propaganda. “We cut out every mention of Native Americans, but I’m not sure how else we could improve the misleading information,” said Princeton historian Sean Wilentz, detailing the commission’s incremental changes to curricula, such as omitting the fact that John Adams, Samuel Adams, and Thomas Paine were the only Founding Fathers who didn’t own slaves. “We did find that most public schools don’t discuss the men who helped Betsy Ross sew the American flag. Other than that, there isn’t too much to change unless we pretend the Vietnam War never happened. Or I guess we could emphasize the plight of former slave owners during Reconstruction.” At press time, the 1776 Commission was editing a section on Abraham Lincoln to clarify that “he had a gun on him” at the time of his assassination."
565,"BEIJING—In an effort to crack down on overly harsh dissent, President Xi Jinping jailed Chinese real estate tycoon Ren Zhiqiang Tuesday for failing to use the sandwich method of constructive criticism when condemning him. “He should have started with something nice, slipped in some feedback on my coronavirus response, and then ended on another compliment,” said Xi, who called the businessman’s criticism of his response to the coronavirus outbreak in the nation “hurtful” as well as “unproductive.” “Look, this isn’t how we do things around here. Instead of attacking by calling me ‘a clown stripped of his clothes,’ he should have started with an ‘I’ statement. This is how the Chinese Communist Party has operated for nearly 100 years, and he knows that. Hopefully, this case can serve as an example to other dissidents thinking about criticizing my regime without first praising my work ethic.” At press time, Xi added his critics should always feel welcome to privately talk one-on-one with him."
566,"NEW YORK—As the Democratic presidential nominee ramped up his in-person efforts to get out the vote, members of the Joe Biden campaign reportedly went door-to-door Tuesday in the JPMorgan Chase headquarters. “Door-knocking is a core part of talking to supporters and getting our message out there, which is why we’re spending the day knocking on each and every office door in the entire building,” said Biden deputy campaign manager Pete Kavanaugh, adding that hundreds of volunteers were reaching out to every wealth manager, data analyst, and investment associate at the 383 Madison building to seek support and donations for the Democratic nominee before canvassing at the headquarters of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. “We explain to every potential supporter what a great candidate Biden is and how his vision for the country will make their lives better. We hope to get a commitment to vote, of course, but a little donation doesn’t hurt either. Polls show that the 12th floor is a tossup so we’re definitely focusing on that. A lot of these people were Hillary [Clinton] supporters in 2016, but we’re not taking anything for granted, and the Wall Street demographic represents our key supporters.” At press time, several members of the Biden campaign team expressed disappointment after speaking with several bankers who said they didn’t really see a difference between the two candidates."
567,"WASHINGTON—Expressing outrage that the network’s moderators would stoop so low on a nationally televised town hall, Fox News pundits slammed CNN Friday for providing Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden each question seconds before he answered it. “Biden’s responses to CNN’s questions clearly show that he’d been tipped off as to what the question was going to be at least several seconds beforehand when it was being asked—how is that fair?” askedTucker Carlson Tonighthost Tucker Carlson, echoing the criticisms of several other conservative media outlets that Biden was given an unfair advantage by getting to hear the entire question before replying. “Seriously, I thought these people learned their lesson after what happened in 2016 with Hillary Clinton, but it’s absolutely clear from the way Biden listens to their questions and responds that he had listened to their questions before responding. This is the kind of bias we have in the media right now. You know that if Donald Trump was at the town hall instead they would make him answer the question before it was asked.” Fox News pundits additionally slammed CNN for unfairly  giving Biden’s campaign advance notice about the town hall’s format, location, and the fact that it was being nationally televised."
568,"WASHINGTON—Telling reporters the organization would help combat decades of left-wing indoctrination about the country’s founding, Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday establishing the “1946 Commission,” a project dedicated to teaching students that America started at the president’s birth. “For too long, liberals have deceived our students into thinking the miracle of this country’s origin stretched back to 1776, when the reality is it didn’t really come together until one beautiful June morning at Jamaica Hospital in Queens, New York,” said Trump, explaining that he had been inspired to create the commission after learning the disturbing fact that 9 in 10 U.S. high school students failed to name a single one of the Trump relatives in attendance at his birth. “One of the most incredible and patriotic moments in the history of the United States occurred when I emerged from my mom’s birth canal, and this commission is going to make sure kids know they have to use that lens to look at pivotal points in the country’s development, like when I got into Wharton or when I renovated the Commodore Hotel. But we also want to make sure kids know more. There are hundreds of beautiful women that I’ve slept with, and these names are being forgotten.” Trump added that the commission would also combat the persistent left-wing propaganda that Barack Obama was the 44th president of the United States."
569,"CAMBRIDGE, MA—Confirming the nation’s social contract was on the brink of collapse, researchers from Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government warned Thursday the democratic process was in peril as millions of registered voters chased after mail-in ballots caught in a gust of wind. “With 30% of the U.S. electorate currently stumbling through the streets in pursuit of their ballots and shouting, ‘Wait, come back!’ we fear this sudden, powerful gale has overwhelmed our electoral system,” said Professor Alanna Friedman, who estimated the number of uncounted votes would continue to grow as millions more Americans accidentally let go of their absentee ballots upon bending down to tie their unlaced sneakers. “Eligible voters across the country are dodging traffic, colliding with pedestrians, and racing down back alleys as they struggle to catch up to the fluttering slips of paper. There is still a chance enfranchisement could be preserved if the wind blows each ballot in a series of loop-de-loops and then coincidentally deposits it in a mailbox, or if an unwitting stranger thoughtfully picks it up, seals the envelope, and drops it in a slot. But if not, it would seem the fate of the great American experiment will come down to whether voters have the courage to dive into hundreds of rivers and creeks and swim after ballots being rapidly whisked downstream.” At press time, reports from across the country confirmed thousands of stately women in city parks were aghast as they peered through pince-nez at their growling Yorkshire terriers, which had finally caught the nation’s windblown ballots and torn them to pieces."
570,"WASHINGTON—In response to criticism for withholding “bombshell” audio of the president, veteran Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward defended his actions Friday by noting journalism has had no effect on Donald Trump so far. “In my defense, I only kept this damning interview with the president from the American people because it’s not going to make any difference whatsoever,” said the reporter famous for breaking the Watergate scandal, adding that he has filed hundreds of hard-evidence-backed stories on the myriadunspeakable things Donald Trump has said and done in the past four years and none of the articles resulted in a single consequence. “Trust me, I would have released this tape of Trump openly brushing off the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Americans back in February if we lived in a world where ironclad evidence of the president’s dishonesty would lead to repercussions—but we don’t. All I’m saying is there were plenty of other stories that made you say, ‘Oh my God, the president behaved unprofessionally,’ back in March, and not one of them moved the needle. I actually thought I was helping by not piling on.” Woodward added that the only way he could see Trump being affected in the slightest by the damning audio would be if someone threw the recording device at him."
571,"BERLIN—Upon waking up from a medically induced coma, Russian opposition leader Aleksei Navalny vowed that he would never again patronize the Tomsk Airport café after getting nerve agent poisoning there, sources close to the vocal Putin critic confirmed Wednesday. “The last time I went there, I got so sick I honestly thought I was going to die,” said Navalny, who added that in the future he would not give his business to any establishment that “screws up something as simple as a cup of tea” by preparing it with Novichok, a highly lethal chemical weapon banned by international treaty. “The worst part is that it’s completely ruined tea for me—I can’t even smell the stuff anymore without wanting to throw up. I’ve tried calling the café’s management to complain, but it’s like they’re afraid to even talk about it. While there’s not really anything they could do to make it up to me, you would think they’d at least offer to send a gift card my way.” According to reports, the outspoken anti-corruption crusader later went online to write a one-star review of the café that simply said, “Do not go here.”"
572,"WASHINGTON—Warning of a possible worst-case scenario, strategists at the Democratic National Committee expressed concern Tuesday that warm, cozy beds on a brisk November morning could keep voters from going to the polls on election day. “We fear thatchilly fall temperatures that make you want to snuggle up in a toasty bed all day, compounded by a plush comforter pulled  up to voters’ chins, could lead to record low voter turnout this November,” said DNC chairman Tom Perez, who explained how election results could be devastated by the allure of just fivemore minutes curled up under the covers, especially if voters wore their favorite fuzzy pajamas. “To counter this, voters need to start preparing now by setting multiple alarms on your phone. We’re also encouraging people to use either an extra heavy blanket that makes them all sweaty, or just a thin sheet so they wake up freezing cold. Alternatively, drink a ton of water the night before so you wake up having to piss like crazy.” At press time, Perez said Democrats’ only hope was enough Americans would get evicted that they wouldn’t have a bed to sleep in."

574,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to improve upon the party’s two-point margin of victory in the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic National Committee confirmed Monday it hoped to notch an even more decisive win of the popular vote this year by devoting all its resources to New York and California. “While our last nominee for president only won by about 3 million votes, we believe that if we concentrate on these two massive coastal population centers we can get that up to 4 or maybe 5 million,” said DNC Chair Tom Perez, who explained the committee would spend hundreds of millions of dollars on TV ads in major media markets such as Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and New York City. “You look at the West Coast, you look at the Northeast, and these places just have a whole lot of Democrats in them. So that’s where we want to do really intensive canvassing for Joe Biden, knocking on every door from Berkeley to Brooklyn to Boston. If we can get those people out to the polls to vote for president, then, in terms of the total number of ballots cast, Biden will have this thing locked up. There’s no telling how badly he’ll beat Donald Trump when you’re looking solely at the popular vote.” According to reports, the DNC was already hard at work on plans for Inauguration Day, when its surrogates will hit the cable news circuit to discuss how, if the Constitution provided for the direct election of presidents, Biden would be the one getting sworn in."

It was a truly impressive TV moment,and it may represent a whole new chapter for the dining brand.” Cillizza added that a fact check would be forthcoming, but there was no doubt that the message of delicious and convenient food had stuck a chord with wide swaths of Americans."

THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS—In a bipartisan effort to console constituents after it failed to pass a new stimulus package, the U.S. Congress announced Monday it had sent more than 40 million boxes of saltwater taffy from the island of St. Thomas to those Americans at risk of eviction without an extension of jobless benefits. “During this difficult time, we wanted to let Americans know we’re thinking of them with this saltwater taffy assortment, which includes vanilla, peppermint, molasses, root beer, and many other great flavors,” read a  message to struggling, unemployed Americans that was scribbled on the back of a scenic postcard  and signed by every member of Congress, with many signatures reportedly obscured by a sticky, fragrant substance resembling pineapple juice. “While we’ve been busy parasailing, scuba diving, and, most recently, watching taffy be made on a very cool crank machine from the 1920s, we assure you we have not forgotten about the troubles back home. That’s why we’ve drafted a proposal to purchase $100 million in sweatshirts that say ‘Lifeguard’ and ‘I run on island time’ from the store inside the resort we’re staying at. But for now, whether you’re in an expensive legal battle with your landlord, in the hospital, or sleeping under a bridge, we hope you’ll enjoy this little taste of the island life. Be careful, though: Ol’ [Sen.] Dick Durbin [D-IL] nearly lost a filling eating his taffy!” At press time, federal officials confirmed the funding needed to transport mail from St. Thomas to the U.S. mainland had been stripped from the Postal Service’s budget."

589,"WASHINGTON—Appearing to relish the wounded look on his chief of staff’s face, President Donald Trump reportedly added another sensational nickname for Democratic vice-presidential pick Kamala Harris to his list Wednesday after the devastating sobriquet succeeded in making Mark Meadows cry. “That’s it, that’s the one,” said Trump, who according to sources reached for a nearby memo pad to write down the prospective nickname after Meadows burst into tears and stormed out of the room upon being called Mark the Misfit. “That hurt him pretty good. The man even begged me to stop. I liked Bogus Mark, too, but he didn’t cry for that one until I slapped him. So maybe we go with Kamala the Misfit. Or ’Mala the Misfit? Does that still work? I just wish I could get something with a C or K.” At press time, sources confirmed a frowning Trump was trying to remember if the word “charismatic” was supposed to be a good or bad thing."

For God’s sake, we’re a Christian nation, not a Christian one.” At press time, Beck also warned of an increasingly bleak future where Americans were forced to take time off of work for Christian holidays and refer to America as “one nation, under God.”"

We’re still hashing out the list of speakers, but we’ll definitely have you, Barack, and Jill offer remarks, and then we’ll end the ceremony with the orchestra playing ‘Danny Boy.’” At press time, Harris was accompanying Biden as he scoped out potential burial sites in Wilmington."

For instance, I just found out that he is a father and husband—family is very important to me. Hopefully, his campaign plans to spend some money on television advertisements so I can hear about his vision for America in the coming days and months. Or maybe the newspaper will print some articles that get into his policy proposals. That would definitely help me get to know him better so that I can make an informed decision come November. Wow, see, I just learned that he likes golfing just like me.” At press time, McGraw admitted he hasn’t yet heard who Trump’s opponent will be but plans to set some time aside to research that as well."

So allow me to extend my sincerest fuck-you for everything you’ve done. Obviously, we’re going to be working together soon, so I look forward to crushing you the first chance I get.” Pelosi added that when things became official in November, she would call again to express how frustrated she was to welcome Bowman to Congress."

The web can send text and images right to people’s computer screens, so it may actually turn out to be an effective means of spreading the vice president’s message.

Supporting workers is not going to happen anyway, so don’t get all stressed. Look, this is not the time to beat yourself up over whether you’re doing enough to prevent a cataclysmic economic decline.

606,"ATLANTA—With public health experts decrying his decision last week to reopen the state’s beaches, Georgia Gov.

We’re sending 300,000 surgical masks to a new state in the middle of Maine we’re calling Clovis. Nobody lives there, but it’s going to help drive up demand. The Coral Princess cruise ship is also now a state, a beautiful floating place, and they’re looking for PPE, too.

608,"TALLAHASSEE, FL—In a bold affirmation of faith during a time of widespread global pandemic, the governors of several Southern states confirmed Thursday they have exempted religious services from their shelter-in-place orders, arguing that Covid-19 is a good Christian virus that wouldn’t dare to spread during church. “As far as I can tell, this coronavirus is an upstanding and righteous disease that knows better than to continue its deadly outbreak within a house of God,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a statement later echoed by Govs. Bill Lee of Tennessee, GregAbbott of Texas, and Tate Reeves of Mississippi. “If we were talking about some sort of secular, atheistic virus, churchgoers might have cause for worry. But I believe in my heart this highly communicable pathogen will show respect during services and not do anything to harm the Lord’s flock on our day of rest. Now, what the virus does to the wicked, sinful people in our community—that’s between it and God.” At press time, sources confirmed Southern governors had taken steps to ensure all mosques would be closed indefinitely."
609,"WASHINGTON—Speaking at a press conference to address the growing Covid-19 pandemic, White House senior advisor Jared Kushner admonished resource-stricken states this week that they should have shown some foresight and planned ahead before joining the Union. “To any governors coming to me and saying the White House hasn’t given them what they need, I would urge them to ask why they didn’t consider these possibilities centuries ago when they first joined together into a federal republic?” said Kushner, singling out Texas’ governor in particular and questioning why the Lone Star state didn’t simply start stockpiling their own ventilators or face masks back in 1884 when they allowed the United States to annex them from Mexico.””Some of you, like Massachusetts or Virginia, have actually had several hundred years with the knowledge that our Constitution grants significant independence in resource allocation to individual states. Frankly, you could have decided way back in 1776 that this setup wasn’t for you. Instead, you impulsively formed a unified nation without even considering the consequences. I’m sorry if I don’t sympathize here.” Kushner stressed that he was tired of hearing excuses from states that didn’t begin building a respirator cache in the 18th century because they were busy with westward expansion or that modern germ theory simply had not yet been developed."
610,"WASHINGTON—Saying there was no way the coronavirus could win with such amazing corporations on their side, President Donald Trump kicked off his plan to tackle the medical supply shortage Tuesday by awarding ExxonMobil an exclusive contract to drill for ventilators in the arctic. “Today, the heroic crews at ExxonMobil will travel to Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, where they will drill 6,000 feet below the earth in search of new, undiscovered mechanical breathing devices,” said Trump, signing the $86 billion deal that gave the oil company sole access to survey, drill, and extract from over 30,000 square miles of “vast, untapped reservoirs of respiratory ventilators.” “While this crisis is a challenge, I want to assure the American people that there are millions of medical devices lying just below the arctic surface, and all we need is ExxonMobil’s vast network of drilling rigs to find them. That’s why we’re also announcing the construction of a long-distance ventilator pipeline, as well as an exclusive, multi-billion-dollar contract with Shell to begin extracting ventilators on Native American reservations throughout South Dakota.” At press time, President Trump had reportedly once again downplayed the need for medical supplies after one of ExxonMobil’s largest offshore tankers exploded."
611,"WASHINGTON—Taking drastic action to address the country’s critical medical supply shortages as well as rising jobless claims, President Donald Trump announced a plan Friday to retrain the nation’s 3 million unemployed Americans to work as human ventilators. “We’re going to put Americans back to work by teaching them to lock lips with infected coronavirus patients and pump air into and out of their lungs,” said Trump, who explained how the Department of Labor would be giving all out-of-work Americans an opportunity to take an accelerated training course to learn how to successfully provide ventilatory assistance to Covid-19 patients with their mouths. “States asked for help, and we’ve listened. This is going to save hundreds, potentially thousands of lives, and put our nation’s great service workers back on their feet. There are thousands of very, very sick people waiting across the country with their mouths gaping open.” At press time, Trump told reporters that if unemployment numbers continue to rise, that many of the jobless could take on roles as hospital beds."

We know you want to have it now, but it took us quite a bit of negotiating to get this money together, and we want to make sure you aren’t just going to run out and blow it all on a bunch of stuff you don’t need. So, keep your nose out of trouble, and one day this fund will be there waiting for you when you want it for something really important.” At press time, Grassley explained how multinational corporation Boeing could receive money from the federal government anytime it wanted because it had already won over lawmakers by generously spending so much money since its last bailout on donations to congressional campaigns."
614,"WASHINGTON—Mulling solutions to stop the disease’s rapid spread across the country, President Donald Trump reportedly suggested Tuesday ceding New York to the coronavirus as a possible appeasement strategy. “We are committed to looking at all options as we work through the invasion of this virus on our shores, including ceding at least the city of New York and potentially the entire state in order to meet the virus halfway and spare the rest of America from further suffering,” said Trump at a press conference, adding that his understanding of what the coronavirus wanted led him to believe that New York’s 54,000 square miles and nearly 20 million residents would be sufficient to placate the respiratory disease. “We’re not in a good situation right now, but I think we can find a solution that will make me happy, make the American people happy, and make the virus happy. This is a win-win and everyone gets what they want. This is a big, big change, but in the end we’re going to like the final result. I think this is a sacrifice everyone is willing to make. The virus should know that we respect where it’s coming from and how dangerous it is, which is why we’re offering a very big state. This is a very smart virus and it will know a good deal. I’d take this deal if I were the virus. Some of my advisors suggested Rhode Island or New Hampshire, but I know that won’t be enough. We’re hoping the coronavirus will be reasonable. We’re hoping that if we give the coronavirus New York that will be enough and it will go back to China or Italy or wherever it came from. Maybe we’ll throw in New Jersey as well.” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he was willing to work with Trump but that ceding the entire state to the coronavirus was too much, and asked if he could reduce the offering to just the state’s prisons and migrant detention centers."

This is America, and work is important here. Without work, the virus has no purpose. Right now, there are millions of virus particles just sitting around and doing nothing. The coronavirus wants to work, so we’re going to put it back to work as soon as possible.” At press time, the Dow had skyrocketed as the coronavirus returned in full strength back into the American workforce."

What’s the big deal? Didn’t we all decide this was cool in the 2008 recession? Last time I checked, using sensitive information to enrich yourself at the expense of hundreds of millions of other people was totally fine. I talked to Kelly [Loeffler] and Ron [Johnson] about cashing out, and nobody even batted an eye. What’s the point of being a senator if you can’t profit off the world’s problems? I’m making money, not losing it, but I guess jealous people have decided that becoming rich and powerful from a national tragedy is suddenly evil. There’s something seriously wrong with this country.” At press time, Burr announced his intentions to resign after shamefully admitting he only pulled in a 22% return from his insider trading."
618,"WASHINGTON—Striking an optimistic note in his daily press briefing about the global pandemic, President Donald Trump spoke to reporters Thursday, detailing his administration’s best case scenario projections for coronavirus where eight million Iranian people are killed. “If we’re very lucky, we could be looking at many millions of dead Iranians, which is why we must do everything in our power to act,” said Trump, confirming that the U.S. government would be pouring resources into continued sanctions and military action against Iran to boost those numbers. “We’re taking this very seriously and monitoring the situation at all times, and we’re hopeful that we could hit this target, or maybe even go past it, but the reality is, this is just a projection and it could tragically be as low as three or four million. We need help from every sector to make sure these citizens are unable to receive medical assistance and continue dying in the street.” When pressed by reporters, Trump acknowledged that the time had come to confront the ugly reality that at least some Iranians would survive."
619,"WASHINGTON—With markets plummeting and many workers losing jobs as the coronavirus pandemic wreaks havoc on businesses, President Donald Trump announced Thursday a plan to stimulate the economy by sending a rare autographed 8-by-10-inch glossy photograph of himself to every U.S. resident. “We know people are hurting financially, so in order to assist them at this critical time, I will be sending out these exclusive and very high-quality signed Donald J. Trump headshots to every American,” said the president, explaining that the approximately 330 million recipients of the exclusive collector’s items could sell them for a hefty sum and then use the cash to cover rent, groceries, and medical bills, which would, in turn, pump billions of dollars back into the economy. “Look, I’m a pretty well-known guy, so these things should definitely fetch a nice price and be a huge help to our workers, sustaining them through a difficult moment in our country’s history. All we ask is that you do choose to sell them and spend the money now, for the sake of the economy, rather than holding on to these beautiful, limited-edition keepsakes as they inevitably appreciate in value. This is truly the stimulus we’ve all been waiting for.” At press time, critics had assailed Trump for exploiting a loophole in the new plan that allows him to send large corporations hundreds of thousands of extra autographed photos of himself."
620,"WASHINGTON—Celebrating his own ingenuity in the face of the Covid-19 outbreak, President Donald Trump’s senior advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner triumphantly announced his new plan Thursday to move the Centers for Disease Control headquarters to Jerusalem. “The dire situation with the coronavirus demands bold solutions, and the time is now to move the CDC headquarters thousands of miles across the Atlantic,” said Kushner, gesturing to a map of the West Bank and indicating that a Palestinian neighborhood would need to be paved over to begin construction on the state-of-the-art facility. “While all operations will be delayed for a few months so we can get started, once everything is up and running, we’ll be able to address this pandemic from one of the world’s most historically significant cities. We’re taking the world’s best doctors, scientists, epidemiologists, and immunologists to an entirely different continent to solve this global crisis. Finally, we’ll be able to streamline collaboration between the CDC and the U.S. Israeli Embassy.” At press time, Kushner announced further plans to build strip clubs on Jerusalem’s holy sites for CDC employees who may be homesick for Atlanta."
621,"WASHINGTON—As his administration makes plans to combat the economic damage caused by the coronavirus with direct payments to Americans, President Donald Trump reportedly conferred with aides behind closed doors Wednesday to confirm he would be among those citizens receiving a pair of $1,000 checks. “Hey, I’m also getting in on this deal, right?” Trump reportedly said to a White House economic strategist he had pulled aside, asking him to double-check the list of recipients and make sure he was on there, since he was “an American too, after all,” and it was “only fair” he receive the same assistance as everyone else. “How soon are these things coming? Can we expedite them? An extra couple grand would be nice right about now. I should get my check first because I’m president and I’ve been working hard. Everyone else should get theirs after me. Maybe we could have a televised ceremony where I receive the check. That would boost morale, especially if I got a little more money than everybody else. Also, my kids are going to get them too, right? Is there any way those ones could just be forwarded directly to me?” At press time, sources reported that Trump increased the proposed amount of money Americans would be receiving to $2,687 after learning that taxes would have to be taken out."
622,"NEW HAVEN, CT—Speaking out against proposals to provide federal assistance to Americans hardest hit by the pandemic-fueled economic downturn, local conservative Mark Garrett expressed worry Wednesday that relief checks would discourage citizens from learning to provide for themselves by killing him and taking his property. “People in this country should have enough self-reliance to stand on their own two feet, bust down my door, cut my throat, and seize all of my possessions,” said Garrett, adding that in America, there are plenty of profits to be had by anyone motivated enough to just go out there and forcibly take them. “There’s a real moral hazard here: When you pay people for doing nothing, it rewards them for being too irresponsible to look at all the wealth I’ve accumulated and realize that if they simply kidnapped my family and held them for ransom, I would eagerly pay it. A resourceful person wouldn’t even need a gun, not if they were enterprising enough to come at me with a knife, an ax, or a tire iron. At the end of the day, if you’re not willing to murder me while I’m asleep in bed and pocket all my valuables, you’re not willing to work.” Garrett went on to ask why federal funds couldn’t instead be given to the national guard, which would need to be sent in to impose martial law when the peasants began to riot."
623,"WASHINGTON—In order to alleviate the heavy damage the crucial financial sector is facing in the midst of the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, the United States Congress announced Tuesday that they would be allocating $2 trillion in order to bail out the struggling bailout industry. “The bailout industry is on the brink of failure, so in order to prevent a full-on catastrophe, we are setting aside $2 trillion in order to bail it out,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that the business of giving of massive sums of money to corporations so they can cover their losses is at the very bedrock of the U.S. economic system, and without assistance, the entire bailout industry as we know it could collapse, which could lead to another Great Depression. “During a crisis like this, the bailout industry is often hit the hardest, so we are taking immediate action, as our economy is deeply dependent on the bailout system; if bailouts can’t function, then America can’t function. A cash injection is absolutely necessary to make sure these failing businesses can inject cash into failing businesses.” At press time, Congress had signed a bill to allocate funds to bail out their bailout of the bailout industry."
624,"WASHINGTON—In a bid to secure support for his nomination as the Democratic Party’s candidate for president, Joe Biden reportedly pledged Sunday to select a woman as vice president since the position doesn’t entail much anyway. “I promise that my vice president will be a woman, since pretty much anyone can do this job, so I figure, hey, might as well pick a lady,” said Biden, adding that he knew from experience in his eight years as U.S. vice president that the position was essentially ceremonial and required no real work, so he had no reservations about handing it to a woman. “You basically just sit on your can all day and maybe show up at a meeting every month or two, so if a woman wants to do that, be my guest. I could see myself selecting [Senator] Amy Klobuchar, [former Georgia State Rep.] Stacey Abrams, or any one of the tens of millions of women perfectly capable of pulling off this no-show gig. I don’t really care what her politics are, and anyway it hardly matters. This works out well, actually, since I can stick a lady in the VP spot and don’t have to put one in an important role on the cabinet.” At press time, Biden was being praised by members of the media and his own party for his commitment to symbolic representation in an office that most people forget about half the time."
625,"WASHINGTON—Amid widespread criticism of the key role he has played in President Trump’s Covid-19 response, a frustrated Jared Kushner confirmed Friday he was struggling to understand why everyone in the media was attacking his qualifications as if they didn’t also get their jobs through pure nepotism. “I don’t get why I’m being slammed by all these cable news commentators and opinion columnists who, if they were put in charge of a pandemic by a powerful family member, would smugly assume they knew exactly what to do too,” said the senior adviser to the president, who explained he was especially hurt to see so many of his fellow Harvard University alumni denouncing one of their own. “You guys are acting all holier-than-thou, but if your father-in-law were president of the United States instead of a board member at some media conglomerate, you’d choose to work in the West Wing, too. Just fucking admit it.” Kushner added that this went for “all the little hypocrites” at Fox News too, who he claimed were also judging him, even if they were afraid to say it out loud."
626,"WASHINGTON—In an official White House press release as the administration’s leading advisor on the viral pandemic, Jared Kushner announced Friday that doctors HATE him after he discovered one weird trick that will CURE coronavirus. “Doctors DON’T want you to know this, but you can DESTROY coronavirus FROM HOME in under 24 hours with this one simple method!!!!” read Kushner’s statement in part, advising all U.S. citizens to visit the websitewww.KushCures.govNOW to experience the 100% effective coronavirus CURE discovered by a DAD. “My quick and easy coronavirus solution is helping families everywhere! To learn more, send $100 to the CDC to Find Out Now why Doctors HATE it but Moms LOVE it! Medical experts everywhere were STUMPED by the coronavirus, and they IGNORED me just because I didn’t have a doctor license, but they just don’t want you to know about this AMAZING LIFE HACK that will ensure you never have to visit your hospital for coronavirus—ever again! Plus, not only is my 30-second MIRACLE CURE completely effective at ERADICATING coronavirus, it will also help you Lose Up To 5 Pounds Of Belly Fat—and KEEP IT OFF!!!” Kushner’s official press release reportedly concluded with an exclusive limited-time offer to buy an iPad from the government for under $24."
627,"WASHINGTON—Saying he was on top of the situation and the disease would not be spreading any further, President Donald Trump assured the nation Friday that he had called 911 to report the coronavirus pandemic and that help was on its way. “I just got off the phone with 911, they are aware of the situation, and we’ll soon have this thing taken care of,” the commander-in-chief said during a televised address on Covid-19, urging all 330 million Americans not to worry because emergency response personnel should be arriving to assist them any minute now. “I made sure to tell the operator this thing was important, and she agreed with me. So everyone should just relax and wait for them. They can send the fire department and the ambulance or both, and then they can probably give you a flu shot or something like that. It’s good. We’re in good shape.” At press time, White House sources confirmed the president had dialed 911 again to tell them that everything was actually fine and the nation didn’t need their help at all."
628,"PHILADELPHIA—In a largely measured speech calling for party unity after a string of primary victories, former Vice President Joe Biden took to the stage Tuesday night to extend an olive branch to Biden supporters. “I appreciate the enthusiasm and energy of Joe Biden’s voters, and I want any of his supporters who feel lost or counted out to know that there is a place for them with my campaign,” said Biden, stressing that while he and the vice president did not see eye to eye on every issue, they both shared values that represented a bold new vision for the American people. “Of course, I might have occasionally clashed with Joe Biden in the more strained moments of recent debates, but we also worked together for many years in the Senate. At the end of the day, whether you’re a Biden supporter or a Biden supporter, we have the same goal, which is to get Trump out of the White House and replace him with Joe Biden.” At press time, pundits launched into fevered speculations that the candidate’s speech could contain hints Joe Biden was mulling the choice to appoint Joe Biden as vice president."
629,"WASHINGTON—Beating out her rivals with the help of a little-known technicality, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) was named the Democratic Party’s nominee for president Wednesday after the discovery of an obscure rule that grants the nomination to whoever wins 0.7% of the vote in Missouri. “We weren’t expecting this, but after double-checking the party’s rules, it appears we are obliged to select Tulsi Gabbard as our candidate in 2020,” said Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez, shrugging his shoulders and pointing to a section of a crumbling, yellowed document that contains the esoteric bylaw. “I know a lot of Democrats were probably wondering why she was still in the race. But last night, while cross-referencing an old rule book in preparation for the upcoming debate, we came across this forgotten section of our charter, and, well, it all checks out. I admit it was a pretty cunning strategy on her part. With 100% of precincts now reporting, it appears the congresswoman received exactly 0.7% of votes in the Missouri primary yesterday. And so the time has come for us to put aside our differences and unite behind the next president of the United States, Tulsi Gabbard.” Perez went on to apologize on behalf of his entire party for not awarding the Democratic nomination for president to Sen. Furnifold McLendel Simmons (D-NC) in 1920."
630,"KANSAS CITY, MO—Determined to support all Democratic candidates without exception, local man Todd McMaster reportedly chanted “Vote blue no matter who, vote blue no matter who” Tuesday as he filled in every bubble on his party’s presidential primary ballot. “Let’s see, there’s one for Bernie, one for Biden, one for Klobuchar, one for Buttigieg—and I’d better not forget Warren or Bloomberg or Deval Patrick or Tulsi, ’cause they’re blue, too,” said McMaster, who frantically colored in the circle beside the first name on his form after noticing the candidate was a Democrat, and then did the same for the other 21 Democrats listed. “I’ve never heard of Robby Wells or Rocky de la Fuente III, but if they’re Democrats, they’re getting a vote. Almost got ’em all! Wait, hold on—I don’t see John Delaney or Kirsten Gillibrand on here. Am I supposed to write them in?” At press time, sources confirmed that McMaster had left all the down-ballot races blank."
631,"JOHANNESBURG—Striding across the cement floor of his sparse confines, Joe Biden gave a speech Monday from the South African jail cell where he is still imprisoned for supporting Nelson Mandela. “I have sacrificed a great deal—my freedom, my livelihood, and my safety—in my fight against apartheid, but it has all been worth it to help my great friend Nelson Mandela,” said the former Vice President, his gaunt frame pacing the 8-foot-by-7-foot cell that he has called home since he was arrested for visiting the revolutionary South African civil rights leader in the 1970s. “Despite the fact that I have been unjustly incarcerated here in Africa for decades, I am dedicated to becoming the 46th president of the United States. The fact that I have already been able to serve as your VP and as a senator before that is a testament to what I can accomplish. No walls can contain my mind, and I promise that once I am released, we’re going to the DNC and then on to the White House.” At press time, Biden assured reporters that even if Nelson Mandela does not become his running mate, he does expect an endorsement from the anti-apartheid hero to be forthcoming."

633,"DETROIT—Opening up about the lifelong struggle that has been a source of embarrassment and frustration, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden defended Thursday his record of inappropriately touching women as a symptom of his lifelong struggle with stuttering hands. “Since my childhood, I’ve been burdened with this debilitating problem—anytime I wrap my hands around a woman’s waist or give them a shoulder rub, it’s because of a nervous medical tick,” said Biden, choking up while recounting how much his uncontrollable caressing of women’s backs and touching of their faces have hurt him over the years. “I was often too ashamed in the past to speak about it, but I know there’s some teenager out there grabbing a classmate’s ass who needs to know they are not alone. I’ve dealt with the misfortune of seeing my hands reach out and pull a woman uncomfortably close to me and the embarrassment of them mocking me and saying ‘Stop doing that.’ I’ve worked to get it under control, and I want my supporters to be confident that I will only occasionally be touching women over the course of the presidential campaign.” At press time, Biden was attributing his support of the Iraq war and opposition to school busing as the result of a challenging brain stutter."

It’s the same thing every term. She just can’t help herself when there’s a 67-year-old piece of ass around.” At press time, Ginsburg had reportedly stopped Kearney as he was leaving for the day and asked if he wouldn’t mind staying late to help her with her briefs."

I promise you, I will work tirelessly to overturn the mistakes of the previous administration. We’ll be destroying the river walk and the smart sewer system and ending the Commuters Trust—all wastes of taxpayer money. You deserve a mayor who doesn’t abandon you to fly to other states that he has no chance of winning, or take time away from focusing on your welfare to criticize the intelligence of dedicated, experienced senators. Congratulations, South Bend, your eight-year nightmare is finally over.” At press time, Klobuchar’s administration had convicted 80% of the city’s black population."
636,"WILMINGTON, DE—As the moderate wing of the Democratic Party consolidated its backing around his candidacy, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly wondered Thursday where all this support was back when he still had a functioning brain. “Here’s the deal: I’m flattered that everyone’s voting for me and the big Democratic donors are giving me a lot of money, but look, I used to have a general idea of what was happening, and it would’ve been nice if they’d shown me that kind of support back then,” said the former vice president, trailing off and staring blankly for a moment before telling reporters that he didn’t win a single state when he ran for the party’s nomination in either 1988 or 2008, when he would have been physically and cognitively prepared for the demands of running in a general election. “I’ve been pandering to people and compromising progressive goals for decades, andnowyou’re just throwing all this campaign support and money behind me? I was lucid for 70 years! I honestly can’t figure you people out. Why are you just now saying Joe Biden should be president when I can’t hold a train of thought for longer than 10 seconds or talk to anyone on the campaign trail without getting agitated and sticking my finger in their face? What is your deal?” Sources confirmed that Biden also wondered why the Democrats were supporting him now that he wouldn’t be the only candidate in clear mental decline with a history of reactionary policies in the race."
637,"DETROIT—Stressing the need for inclusivity and intersectionality in the 2020 Democratic primaries, local Bernie Sanders supporter Kevin Randall took to Facebook Wednesday to stress the importance of listening to minority voices, just not any of the ones that have handed victory to Joe Biden. “We need to make clear that, with the exception of those who showed up in droves to vote for Biden in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, our movement has room for all people of color,” wrote Randall, who explained that it’s important to avoid becoming siloed within one’s own narrow worldview and to empathize with Americans from every background who did not just make Biden the new frontrunner last night. “Marginalized groups are being shut out of these conversations, so we need to take a moment to hear what, in particular, 18-to-35-year-old, college-educated, progressive black and Latino voters from western states have to say. They, along with the tiny minority of working-class citizens in disenfranchised minority communities who object to the moderate platform of Joe Biden, should not be made to feel invisible in our democracy.” Randall later added that it was also important to listen to older Jewish people, except for the ones who cast ballots for Mike Bloomberg."
638,"NEW YORK—Expressing her displeasure about the unfortunate timing of her boss dropping out of the presidential primary, Bloomberg staffer Eliza Wilkonson was reportedly frustrated Wednesday that she had literally just aborted a fetus for this job. “God damn it, I wish Mike could have given me a little heads up,” said Wilkonson, confirming her annoyance at having received the news about the former New York mayor suspending his campaign mere minutes after she returned to her office from the abortion clinic. “He’d been dropping hints for weeks about how hard it would be for me to give this job my all if I was distracted with a child, so it would have been nice if he had thought to contact me about his plans before I went to all this trouble. It sucks too because I had been really looking forward to having this kid.” Wilkonson added that she felt especially aggravated knowing that she wouldn’t be able to vent about her situation due to the non-disclosure agreements she’d been forced to sign."
639,"LOS ANGELES—Touting his Super Tuesday victories as evidence that he would stand strong in the face of any real change, Joe Biden announced Wednesday that his incredible electoral comeback proves he can beat a progressive Democrat in the general election. “Democratic voters have spoken, they know that when it comes to the presidential election, I would be by far the most likely candidate to defeat Bernie Sanders,” said Biden, who cited his strength among a wide variety of demographic groups as proof he was the unity figure the party needs to fight back against the Democratic Socialists they would be facing in November. “People know this election is the most important of our lifetime, and we need to nominate someone who can stop progressive policies in their tracks. In fact, if we harness that energy, I have no doubt we can deliver a resounding defeat to the entire Democratic party.” Biden ended his victory speech by claiming that if this momentum continued, the Democrats could be celebrating their biggest victory over their opponents ever at July’s convention."
640,"CLARKSVILLE, AR—In an effort to reduce confusion and improve transparency, Democratic National Committee officials confirmed that last-minute changes to the Super Tuesday primary rules would require all 14 states to vote at the same polling place. “We want to consolidate the process and cut down on red tape, so Democratic voters casting ballots in any of today’s 14 primary races need to report to Pyron Elementary in Clarksville, AR before polls close at 7:30 p.m.,” said DNC chair Tom Perez, adding that voters from Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia should check in at the table inside the auditorium, accessible from the school’s north entrance, while those from American Samoa would be caucusing in the gym. “Clarksville is centrally located in the middle of the country, which we hope most people will find convenient. We expect the line to stretch a good 20-30 miles long, but once you reach the voting booth, you’ll be in and out—bang—in about 10 minutes. We encourage everyone to be patient, and I recommend bringing enough food and water to last several days. A folding chair probably wouldn’t be a bad idea, either.” At press time, volunteers manning the Clarksville location confirmed that only two of the five voting machines were currently working."
641,"DES MOINES, IA—Expressing optimism about how the upcoming electoral contest would play out, presidential candidate Joe Biden was reportedly feeling confident about his chances this week after spending Super Tuesday stumping across Iowa. “I’ve spent the last 24 hours crisscrossing the state to get people excited about the Biden campaign, and tonight all that hard work pays off,” said the former vice president, recalling the dozens of stops he’d made in towns like Dubuque and Mason City to hold rallies in school gyms and rec centers to urge Iowans to vote. “I’m feeling really good about our chances here, especially since it seems like a lot of my rivals have completely given up on the state. You’d be amazed how shocked Hawkeyes are when they see me stopping into their local diner, and I think we’re going to be able to translate that excitement into big numbers at the polls.” Biden added that he was hopeful his momentum from Iowa would propel him to a knock-out victory in New Hampshire."

This election is too important for Americans to take a risk on this fantasy of a small city mayor who could magically transform politics. The disingenuous, ego-driven promises, soaring rhetoric, and lack of results are why people have grown sick of Washington, and why I should drop out of the presidential race.” At press time, Buttigieg had declined to endorse another candidate, noting that suggesting Democrats had any chance of winning in November would just be another empty promise."
643,"NEW YORK—In a video from late 1984 that was circulating online Friday and could severely damage his bid for the presidency, Bernie Sanders can be heard openly questioning whether Madonna was likely to succeed in the transition from making records to acting in major motion pictures. “Look, she’s an undeniable pop sensation with a promising string of top-20 hits to her credit, but let me tell you something: There’s no guarantee that kind of talent is going to translate to the silver screen,” Sanders, then mayor of Burlington, VT, says in a local public-access broadcast in which he clearly exhibits short-sightedness in his failure to anticipate the undeniable success the Material Girl would achieve in box-office smashes such asA League Of Their OwnandEvita. “Madonna should stick to music. People love thisLike A Virginalbum, it’s a lot of fun to dance to, and she needs to build on its success. Taking time away from that to focus on what are sure to be small, insubstantial roles in lackluster films? That’s career suicide.” Reminded by reporters that Madonna had won acclaim for her role inDesperately Seeking Susanjust a few months after his videotaped remarks, a visibly angry Sanders argued that Rosanna Arquette had carried that entire film and anyone who said otherwise didn’t know “a goddamn thing” about acting."

Cute. By the way, have you ever heard of canvassing, or is the ‘pussy hat’ you wasted crucial primary outreach hours crocheting too snug around your ears? And, while we’re on this, where are the profits from that deluge of enamel pins going? Certainly not to my campaign, last I checked.” At press time, Warren had punched through the glass of a framed poster featuring her head photoshopped onto Wonder Woman’s body that her “so-called supporters” had mailed to her campaign headquarters."
645,"WASHINGTON—Noting that he would happily lend his support to any candidate who just requested it, former President Barack Obama told reporters Friday he was kind of hurt no one in the 2020 Democratic field has even asked for his endorsement. “Look, I don’t want to toot my own horn here, but I’m a two-term president with significant pull among Democratic voters and I can’t help but feel a little bummed that no campaign has even raised the question of whether I’d consider endorsing them,” said the 44th commander in chief, stressing that he would happily express his full-throated approval for Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or any of the race’s other candidates if they had even so much as broached the topic with him during recent in-person conversations, email chains, and phone calls. “Especially Joe. I mean, I worked with the guy for eight years, and he hasn’t even reached out to test the waters. I’m not trying to overstate my significance, but it’s not crazy to think my vouching for what he did as vice president could really change the way this race shakes out, right? I mean, what the hell? I feel like a forgotten man over here.” At press time, the former president had sighed and started drafting an enthusiastic endorsement of Tulsi Gabbard after receiving a request from one of the representative’s assistants."

Sheila, Jen, hush that crying. I don’t care what term you’re on, I’ve got a score to settle. Did you hear what those assholes did to me? Get whatever you want back there because everything’s on me!” At press time, Romney had driven the bus to a nearby obstretician’s office and was waving a fistful of cash in the waiting room, offering $5,000 to anyone who would get an abortion."

Mike is my candidate of choice. I will go to the polls and cast my ballot for Mike, and I will tell all my friends to vote for Mike too. I support Mike Bloomberg for president in 2020. Only Mike can get it done.” At press time, sources confirmed the man was speaking Bloomberg’s name over and over again with increasing urgency while he repeatedly walked into a wall."
649,"CHARLESTON, SC—Clearly uncomfortable being asked to express their views on such a contentious issue, the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates struggled Wednesday to answer questions about the future of granite countertops during a series of HGTV town halls. “As president, what are you going to do to address the fact that wages are stagnating to the point where the vast majority of Americans can’t afford the granite countertops and backsplash tiles they desperately need to fix up their homes?” asked Jonathan Scott, who was moderating the HGTV town hall with hisProperty Brothersco-host Drew Scott, interrupting candidate Pete Buttigieg’s stammering response to note that a majority of voters doubted the former South Bend, IN mayor could effectively unify angry members of the nation’s polarized homeowners associations behind a common lawn care policy. “How do you plan to address the millions of Americans making do with laminate countertops, or who are forced to live in homes where there’s a lack of natural sunlight in the kitchen? Will you commit today to providing the support for all Americans to knock down a wall and open up the floor plan of their common areas? Many people out there are wondering whether their future will include a brick patio or detached deck, or whether they’ll ever even be able to live in a place that is perfect for entertaining. How do you respond?” At press time, Senator Amy Klobuchar was being booed by the HGTV town hall audience after she doubled down on controversial previous statements criticizing crown molding."
650,"DENVER, CO—Stressing that his angry rants and unhinged perceptions of the world in no way represented the Vermont senator’s broad coalition of supporters, 27-year-old Adam Patterson told reporters Wednesday that he was sick and tired of the Sanders movement being defined by a small number of toxic members like himself. “Honestly, I’m just fed up with the mainstream media taking a tiny sample of aggressive and borderline unhinged Bernie supporters like me and suggesting that we somehow represent the millions of completely normal Bernie voters out there,” said Patterson, stressing that the condescending way that he insisted anyone who slightly critiqued Sanders or his plans was a neoliberal shill, white supremacist, or supporter of war criminals did not at all reflect Sanders’ largely issues-oriented campaign. “Look, clearly I’m a lunatic who has lost all touch with reality or historical context. I mean, I’ve repeatedly argued I’d rather live in Venezuela under Nicolas Maduro than the totalitarian state of America. That’s crazy. And, frankly, I’m sure if Bernie saw me going online and telling women they were fucking corporatist bitches for supporting Warren, he would condemn it, because it distracts from his generally positive message. But I’m just one person. Should the media get to cast all Bernie supporters in a negative light just because of a few complete and utter assholes like me?” At press time, Patterson had decided that the best solution to the mischaracterization was to tell a female journalist who wrote about Bernie Sanders’ history of praising left-wing dictatorships to get ovarian cancer and die."
651,"WASHINGTON—Declaring that he was looking forward to showing the influential global entity around the country, President Donald Trump held a diplomatic ceremony Wednesday to formally welcome the coronavirus to the United States. “This is a historic day for America, and I hope that the coronavirus will appreciate our efforts to give it a warm reception and work with us to build a thriving, mutually beneficial relationship,” said the president, announcing that Covid-19 would join him on the White House South Lawn for the presentation of an American flag accompanied by a military brass band, before a meeting with high-ranking administration officials and leaders from the business community in the Oval Office. “We have a full itinerary planned over the next few days in which will tour a variety of Washington cultural sites, newly built manufacturing facilities, and even the state-of-the-art Johns Hopkins Hospital, so the coronavirus can observe firsthand the best of American pride and ingenuity. We are excited to develop a stronger bond with such an influential force in the international community, and we hope that a strong partnership with the coronavirus could lead to further diplomatic relations with H1N1, SARS, and other prominent global viruses.” At press time, a Trump administration spokesperson announced a change to the diplomatic itinerary after the coronavirus had expressed an interest in touring the CDC director’s lungs."
652,"CHARLESTON, SC—As the televised event featuring the leading contenders for the Democratic Party presidential nomination got underway Tuesday evening, CBS moderators kicked off the debate by asking whether Michael Bloomberg was ready to get his shit rocked again. “Our first question is for Mayor Bloomberg: How will you respond to another two hours of the other nominees just completely wrecking your shit?” saidCBS This Morningco-host Gayle King, citing the fact that the billionaire former New York City mayor had spent the debate six days earlier “getting absolutely bodied” and wondered whether he had a plan to prevent “a complete and total roasting” from happening again. “Mr. Bloomberg, do you believe that you prepared this time, and is it going to be enough? Because from where we’re sitting, you got ripped a new one last debate, and now you’re about to be hit from every side. Honestly, after seeing how easy it was last time, we wouldn’t be surprised if the other candidates are even better prepared to tear you apart. Tonight, the whole country is watching to see if you have any plan to avoid getting fucking hammered again. You ready?” Sources confirmed that fellow CBS moderator Norah O’Donnell then interjected and told Bloomberg that they would give him 30 seconds to run off the stage if he still wanted to save himself before it started."
653,"CHARLESTON, SC—Stressing that the contrast between herself and her rivals could not be starker, presidential candidate Amy Klobuchar told viewers at Tuesday night’s Democratic debate that she remained the only candidate who had not been sucker punched in the gut moments before stepping on stage. “Tonight, I’m asking voters to really think about the distinct choice they’re being offered between a heartland Democrat with a record of serious accomplishments and six other candidates who have spent this entire debate doubled over and collapsing in front of their podiums or wheezing for air,” said the Minnesota senator, pointing to her distinguished record of not getting absolutely clocked in the moments before a national television appearance before gesturing across the stage at a whimpering Bernie Sanders clutching his stomach as he rolled around in agony. “Ask yourself, if Elizabeth Warren wasn’t prepared to get slugged right in the breadbasket as she stepped into the spotlight, then do you really think she’ll be ready for the presidency? Now you’ve seen what my fists are capable of this evening, and if you’re ready for a different type of candidate—one who isn’t whimpering and begging for mercy—then I promise you a place with me.” At press time, Klobuchar had torn into Michael Bloomberg’s supposedly tough-on-crime record as the dry heaving former New York City mayor began to retch onto the debate floor."
654,"WASHINGTON—Expressing doubt over whether she deserved of all her accolades, Supreme Court Associate Justice Elena Kagan was reportedly worried Tuesday that she was a fraud after being the only female justice not called out by President Donald Trump for being biased against him. “Has my career meant nothing? I feel so invisible,” said Kagan, gazing at her reflection in a mirror and questioning what it was her fellow female justices have that she herself lacks. “I mean, I was solicitor general as well as dean of Harvard Law School and I thought that was impressive, but does that even really mean anything if the president isn’t calling on me to recuse myself from cases involving him? This man should hate me, yet he hasn’t said a word about me voting against his wealth test for immigrants, or any of my other rulings. Am I just a big phony?” At press time, Kagan was trying to comfort herself by considering that a mistaken Trump might think she was actually a Bush appointee."
655,"AHMEDABAD, INDIA—Representing the United States during a diplomatic visit to India, President Donald Trump hailed the blossoming relations between the two planets during a rally Monday at the 110,000-seat Motera Stadium. “Although we may come from different worlds, and our civilizations are separated by millions of lightyears, the bonds we share are still incredibly powerful,” said Trump, who marveled aloud at the strange vegetation and peculiar culture of the foreign planet, remarking to aides that the inhabitants of India were “a lot like us,” despite their extraterrestrial origin. “When I landed here in my flying craft after a long journey at warp speed through multiple galaxies, your entire planet came out into the streets to welcome me as if I were a member of your own species. That’s something I’ll never forget. May our two countries continue to exist in interplanetary harmony, sending a message of peace to the rest of the universe.” Trump later complimented Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to combat the intergalactic Muslim threat that puts their shared star system in danger."
656,"LAS VEGAS—Acknowledging the blunder following public pressure that his patient release the confidential documents, embarrassed heart surgeon Dr. Michael Sharrer admitted to reporters Monday that he may have accidentally left Bernie Sanders’ medical records in the candidate’s chest. “Honestly, I just set them down for a second, and before I knew it he was all closed up,” said Sharrer, who speculated that he must have misplaced the Vermont senator’s health records inside Sanders’ thoracic cavity while performing the stent procedure with the scalpel in one hand and the files in the other back in October. “It was a manila folder filled with all kinds of test results and charts. It probably got tucked behind the rib cage. I really should have been more careful considering that was our only copy. We could try an X-ray, but they might be difficult to read because they’re probably all bloody. Man, we should really switch to digital records.” At press time, Sanders’ critics were calling upon the presidential candidate to cut open his chest to release the records."
657,"WASHINGTON—In a legal measure that will greatly expand the options available to American sportsmen, the Trump administration announced Thursday that it would repeal legacy regulations forbidding the use of controversial chokeholds and eye-gouging when hunting game birds. “Although animal rights activists have long decried placing grouse in sleeper holds, piledriving pheasants, and headbutting doves, we recognize that these inarguably effective moves have a long tradition among wingshooters,” said President Donald Trump in a press conference, adding that no less a man than Theodore Roosevelt had thought nothing of roundhouse kicking a brace of ducks for his dinner. “They call the move the ‘Crossface Chicken Wing’ for a reason. Furthermore, banning the use of the common folding chair as an implement for slamming birds across the head is a holdover from the days of ignorant environmentalists who don’t respect traditional hunting. True woodsmen know that respecting nature often means wrapping barbed wire around your fist to pummel a Canada goose or digging your thumbs into the eyes of a woodcock, and that there isn’t a hunter alive who wouldn’t curb stomp a wild turkey.” President Trump then posed for photographs while repeatedly smashing a quail beak-first into one of the White House’s marble columns."
658,"WASHINGTON—Increasingly troubled about the role the self-proclaimed visionary and healer might play in the presidential race, intelligence experts expressed concerns Friday that Volokov Molchalin, the pale Russian mystic constantly at President Donald Trump’s side, may attempt to influence the 2020 election. “While we’re unsure exactly what Volokov is whispering into Trump’s ear—or if it’s a known language at all—it’s the consensus of the intelligence community that he likely intends to meddle in the upcoming election, perhaps by using his self-professed hypnotic powers to sway the American public,” said National Intelligence Director Joseph Maguire, noting that the long-bearded Eastern Orthodox prophet had enjoyed unprecedented access to the Oval Office since laying his hands on the president’s thigh in early June and allegedly curing him of an internal hemorrhage. “What’s more unsettling is that Volokov has only grown more brazen in his attempts to alter the president’s behavior, encouraging Trump to purify himself by self-flagellating, filling the West Wing with frankincense, or repeating occult incantations until his eyes roll back in a mystical trance. We’ve also received reports that Volokov can read minds, which would obviously make any counterintelligence efforts difficult, if not impossible.” At press time, terrified officials had escalated their warnings after a failed assassination attempt in which repeated stabbings, a gunshot wound to the head, and an apparent drowning in the freezing Potomac River failed to end the Russian mystic’s life."
659,"NEW YORK—Standing behind podiums scattered around the living room, Mike Bloomberg’s housekeepers braced for another day of dressing up like DNC candidates and letting their boss beat them in a debate, sources confirmed Thursday. “I’m supposed to be polishing the silver today, but instead I have to wear a stupid white wig and let Mr. Bloomberg attack the feasibility of my Medicare-for-all plan,” said maid Flora Bishop, who feared the 15-person housekeeping staff would be unable to complete their daily cleaning tasks as their boss forced them to restart the debate yet again after fumbling a question about prison reform. “We basically just stand around and let him tear our policies apart until he feels like he’s won. Usually, I’ll just say something about how all my ideas are bad compared to his so I can get back to the laundry. I feel terrible for the landscaper who played Buttigieg last time. Mr. Bloomberg fired him after he made a really good point about trying to buy the election.” At press time, the housekeepers were frantically motioning for the chauffeur, who was acting as moderator, to stop pressing their boss on stop-and-frisk policing tactics."
660,"WASHINGTON—Imploring his supporters to relieve him of his obligations on the campaign trail, former vice president and current presidential candidate Joe Biden reportedly begged his donors Thursday to stop sending him money so he could quit the presidential race. “Look, folks, we are at an important crossroads in our bid for the nomination, and I’m asking you from the bottom of my heart to please, please stop giving to my campaign so I can just end it already,” Biden wrote in an email sent to every individual, corporation, and political action committee that has contributed to his campaign, adding that with their generous help, they could help put him out of his misery at this “crucial juncture” right before the Nevada caucus. “I’m going to be honest with you. We’re being outpaced in fundraising by the other campaigns, and that is great, because I am very, very tired and ready to admit defeat; so please, whether you have $1 or $100 to spare, don’t send either. I know I can count on you to support me as I head back into retirement and try to pretend none of this ever happened.” At press time, sources confirmed Biden began openly weeping when he received a $4 million surge in donations."
661,"LAS VEGAS—In a powerful testament to the role television advertising still plays in driving national polls, increased airtime of commercials for tobacco cessation aid Chantix led to celebrity spokesperson Ray Liotta qualifying for Wednesday night’s Democratic Debate. “Chantix has made some especially aggressive ad purchases in recent months that helped spread the word about Ray Liotta and his struggle to find a stop-smoking aid that works for him,” said polling expert Kevin Michaels, stressing that the extensive television ad campaign familiarized Americans with Liotta as a “father, actor, and ex-smoker” and directly led to the polling surge that secured his place on the debate stage. “What these ads have done for key sections of the electorate is not only boost awareness of Liotta, but also expose voters to his difficulties to quit cold turkey before eventually finding a way to overcome his urge to smoke with Chantix. It’s a message of hope that’s clearly resonating with voters.” At press time, experts suggested the strategy may have backfired after Amy Klobuchar hammered Liotta for pushing a product that can cause changes in behavior, depressed mood, and nausea."
662,"LAS VEGAS—In a demonstration of the high level of enthusiasm the former New York City mayor enjoys among the electorate, surging presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg was met with a standing ovation during the Democratic debate Wednesday as he promised to “rule you peasants with an iron fist.” “Kneel before me and tremble, you piteous wretches, for I am your new sovereign ruler and my will is infallible,” said Bloomberg, cutting into his rivals’ speaking time as his pledge to “vanquish my enemies and reward my supplicants” was met with thunderous applause by thousands of assembled audience members. “You peons, you mean as little to me as a clump of dirt to a mighty mountain, and I’ll step on the necks of every last one of you on my quest for greater and greater power. Gaze upon your new God and fear my capricious wrath.” At press time, the audience had broken out into chants of “Bloomberg! Bloomberg!” as armed guards emerged from the exits to indiscriminately beat them with batons."
663,"LAS VEGAS—After frantically searching for the former vice president in the hours leading up to Wednesday night’s debate, panicked campaign aides reportedly located Joe Biden at Las Vegas’ Treasure Island Hotel, where the candidate appeared to have followed a Cirque du Soleil troupe onstage. “There he is, up there—those circus clowns are tossing him back and forth,” said visibly relieved senior adviser Anita Dunn, waving her arms at the seven-term former U.S. senator, who was attempting to make an impassioned speech about his legislative record despite being severely entangled in aerial silks and dangling 50 feet in the air. “Even if we got him down from there right now, we still wouldn’t make it to the debate venue on time, and he does seem to be shouting his most important talking points at the guys playing those big Japanese drums and the two musclemen flying around on bungees. To be honest, I haven’t seen him looking this coherent in a long time. Why don’t we just let the vice president have a nice night for once?” At press time, Biden was overheard berating a unicycle rider he “didn’t like the looks of” from the confines of a large, whimsical birdcage."
664,"SOUTH BEND, IN—Quipping that if elected, he would be a father first and president second, Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg told reporters Wednesday that he loved his “wife Marcia and two beautiful kids, Tad and Hayden” in his latest campaign shift. “First, I’d like to thank my incredible rock of 15 years, Marcia, and boys, why don’t you come on up to the stage and give your pops a hug?” said the former mayor of South Bend, beckoning to his newly revamped campaign staff and inviting up a tall, slender woman with two suit-clad young boys who immediately sprinted over Buttigieg yelling “Daddy, Daddy.” “This beautiful, intelligent woman right here—she got me through law school, she got me through my mayoral races, and she’s going to get us to the White House. And Tad and Hayden, thank you for coming here today. But you better get going—Daddy knows you have homework to do!” At press time, Buttigieg grabbed his wife and gave her a long kiss on the lips before shrugging and telling the crowd, “Happy wife, happy life!”"
665,"NEW YORK—Citing polling data that suggested the former mayor was tracking poorly among 18- to 25-year-old African Americans, Michael Bloomberg’s presidential campaign hired thousands of canvassers Friday to stop black men on the street and force them to hear his campaign pitch. “We want to make sure black voters can’t walk down the street without hearing Mike’s message loud and clear,” said campaign spokesperson Julie Wood, clarifying that canvassers have received training on the proper tactics for stopping black men and throwing them onto the ground while delivering Bloomberg’s talking points. “We’ve also instructed our canvassers to confiscate any materials supporting other candidates. In some cases, we might actually take some men into custody and bring them back to campaign headquarters. This is a massive undertaking that will run well beyond Super Tuesday. We’ve already set up Bloomberg-branded vans in black neighborhoods across the country to spread our message. It’ll all be worth it once these young black men hear what Bloomberg has to say about funding social security while they’re pressed up against a brick wall with an elbow digging into their backs.” At press time, Bloomberg defended his campaign’s decision to stop black high schoolers on the street, insisting that they’d be of voting age soon enough."

667,"LAS VEGAS—In an effort to ensure reliable results in its Feb. 22 presidential caucus, the Nevada State Democratic Party announced Friday that it had addressed election security concerns by upgrading to a new system of electronic voters. “There is a lot of potential for human error when you have people recording their votes on paper, but we believe we can greatly reduce inaccuracies by digitizing the entire process, including the voters themselves,” said party chair William McCurdy, who explained that electronic voters select candidates faster and more precisely than their human counterparts, allowing delegates to be awarded to the correct candidate immediately and eliminating the need to contest the outcome. “We originally planned to use a new app to tabulate votes, but after witnessing the difficulties experienced in Iowa’s caucuses, we thought, ‘Why not use an app to cast the votes, too?’ It’s far more efficient than systems we’ve used in the past, and the best part is that the results will be available as soon as—well, now, if you’d like them.” At press time, sources confirmed the Nevada party had awarded Joe Biden the 1,990 delegates necessary to secure the Democratic nomination for president."

Of course, Bill Clinton was close, but he was disqualified for using bumpers. But Jimmy Carter’s historic game belongs to the ages now, and only time will tell if another American leader can live up to the standard again.” At press time, the National Park Service was making plans to erect a second obelisk near the Washington Monument after President Carter reportedly scored a perfect 10.0 on his gymnastics vault routine."

Instead, it’s Klobuchar who looks to be the one speaking to their issues—which are vague and ill-defined. She’s definitely an appealing choice for Democrats who blindly vote for any random candidate with a ‘D’ next to their name.” The report concluded by citing Hilary Clinton’s stronghold over the voting block on her path to the 2016 nomination."

It remains to be seen if Bloomberg can bridge the gap of minorities he allowed to be terrorized by the police with another multimillion-dollar TV ad buy.” Bresner added that not all the poll numbers were bad for Bloomberg, noting that he was still beating Pete Buttigieg among young black men the mayor of South Bend had thrown into prison."

No thanks, pig,” said Brooklyn-based campaign volunteer Masha Ariely, expressing the sentiments of many former Sanders proponents who derided the White House hopeful as a “dirty cop” for seeking to wield the strength of a vast global superpower with a nearly $700 billion annual defense budget. “I was pretty excited for Medicare For All, but not if it means I have to vote for a guy who’s going to be giving orders at the Pentagon. We’re talking about an organization complicit in torture at Abu Ghraib, massacres in Vietnam, and a whole slew of war crimes going back to the Mexican–American War.

678,"ROCKPORT, IN—Revealing that the latest addition to the presidential race had totally upended the 2020 election, a national poll conducted Monday found that President Donald Trump, as well as every single Democratic candidate, were now trailing a mysterious rune-covered Obelisk by 80 points. The newest numbers, which come from Emerson College, found that the 200-foot tall pillar, which reportedly has cryptic, glowing symbols engraved onto its surface, is now dominating among Democrats, Republicans, and independents. Several major polls also indicated that after the monolithic column suddenly materialized in a cornfield and began emitting a low humming noise, statisticians observed an extreme uptick in voters who previously supported Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren, Andrew Yang, Amy Klobuchar, Tom Steyer, Mike Bloomberg, and Donald Trump announcing in unison that they intended to cast their ballot for “the one true candidate: the Obelisk.” “From its late entrance into the race to the way it attracts people from all over the political spectrum, the Obelisk is really what you’d call a dark horse candidate,” said pollster Leslie Fabacher, adding that voters responded positively to its imposing figure and independent gravitational field. “Sure, this arcane column made from some indeterminable material could have ended up another Tom Steyer or Michael Bloomberg, but now, Americans of virtually every demographic, regardless of age, gender, race, or religion, are connecting with the Obelisk’s mesmerizing thrum.” “Voters really seem to relate to this Washington outsider that comes from a realm unknown to science,” Fabacher added. According to pollsters, out of the 500 rural Indiana residents surveyed, over 99% pledged total obedience to the infallible Obelisk. In addition, respondents said that they felt confident about the future after gazing upon the constantly shifting runes emblazoned on the monolith. When asked if they would consider voting for a candidate other than the Obelisk, those surveyed were either heard screaming in pain or answered, “The Obelisk is all; we are the Obelisk.” According to the Federal Election Commission, the Obelisk has already shattered all fundraising records as compliant Americans from across the country emptied their bank accounts and flocked to the mystifying pillar to drop all of their earthly possessions in front of it. Polls also showed that pro-Obelisk Democrats and Republicans did not mind that the Obelisk was registered with a party by the name of “[indecipherable runic language].” “When I felt the rumble beneath me and saw a white-hot, screaming Obelisk suddenly appear out of thin air, I knew that was the candidate for me,” said Iowa voter Aaron Yalder, 49, adding that while he had been undecided for months, the Obelisk blinded him and commanded him to drop all other political allegiances. “Sure, I like that Sanders supports the United Steelworkers Union. And I like that Trump is tough on crime. But there was just something about that deep, low voice, speaking in a language I could not comprehend, occupying my every thought and controlling my every move.” “There is only the Obelisk,” Yalder added. “How can you argue with that?” While the enigmatic column has only been in the race for less than 24 hours, the Obelisk has also secured the endorsements of numerous leading political figures, such as Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), as well as former presidents Jimmy Carter, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, who have all been spotted with the Obelisk, unconscious, floating hundreds of feet above the ground. Even organizations such as Priorities USA, America First, and Citizens United have thrown their support and money behind the mysterious pillar, citing it as “The one choice. The only choice.” “Look, when it comes to politics, there’s no other candidate that has connected with all Americans past and all Americans future, and has pledged to reinstate the Clean Waters Act,” said Jessica Karling, a leader at SuperPac American Bridge, rending her clothes and filling the Obelisk’s runes with the blood of her newborn. “I’ve been doing this for over 50 years, and it’s not just the fact I am its vessel and it is my one true God and I would murder anyone for the Obelisk, anyone, just tell me, I’ll kill them—it’s the fact that it really cares about the American people.” “It’s 2020, and this is going to be an election like we’ve never seen before,” she added while bowing down to the Obelisk and self-flagellating with a tulip tree branch. At press time, the Obelisk, which reportedly vaporized Senator Amy Klobuchar, after she denounced the monolith as divisive, immediately surged to a 100% approval rating."
679,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that they were forced to take more radical measures to ensure the success of their moderate political platform, increasingly unhinged U.S. centrists announced Monday their plan to round up the nation’s populace into camps to force them to engage in meaningful dialogue. “As more Americans adopt left-wing or right-wing views, compromise to a moderate position will require more drastic action, which is why we’ve decided to herd every last American into trains and bring them to camps encircled in barbed wire where they will be forced to discuss their views at gunpoint,” said a wild-eyed Leland Welsh, spokesperson for the centrist think tank Third Way, which was behind the funding of the large open-air detention center where divided Americans would be forced to shake hands until their palms bled and go without food and water until they had agreed to understand and embrace the positions of their political opponents. “We believe that all Americans possess the capacity to find a middle ground on every single issue, which is why we’re going to force their eyes open to read opinion pieces by their political adversaries, make them listen to speeches by Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney blaring on loudspeakers 24 hours a day, and compel them to remain standing for long periods of time while our guards scream ‘We can all get along!’ In these camps, expressions of animosity toward another inmate’s belief system, or uttering anything besides the phrase ‘But that’s just my opinion, and I’d love to hear yours’ will be punishable by death. We will stop at nothing to ensure that all Americans hold the exact same centrist belief system.” The visibly crazed political centrists added that if the camps were unable to force any Americans to find common ground with one another, they would sell them in new slave markets to a company that would."

As someone who worked at McKinsey myself, I know firsthand that we can’t win the presidency without them.” At press time, Buttigieg unveiled a new plan to diversify his campaign staff by hiring a single black finance executive to the Pete 2020 board."

683,"WASHINGTON—Insisting that the impressionable youth wasn’t aware of any wrongdoing, Senate Republicans spoke out Thursday saying that one mistake shouldn’t ruin the life of a naive, promising young man like President Donald Trump. “Sure, withholding military aid to an ally in wartime in order to secure an investigation into a political rival isn’t the best, but it’s wrong to squander all of this bright young man’s potential over one little abuse of power,” said Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY), explaining that it would be easy to look back and find a time in pretty much anyone’s life when they tried to compel a foreign government to interfere in a national election because they didn’t know any better. “It would be unfair to blemish this gifted young man’s record forever just because he committed a single high crime in his 70s. Just ask yourself: do we really want this one miscarriage of public trust in democratic institutions to follow him for the rest of his life?” At press time, McConnell was heartened that an acquitted Trump still had an entire life of undermining democracy for his personal benefit ahead of him."
684,"WASHINGTON—Unleashing a tirade on the supreme deity in an overtly partisan display at the traditionally nonpolitical event, President Donald Trump spent Thursday’s National Prayer Breakfast fiercely attacking God for allowing impeachment to ever happen. “As everyone knows, my family, your great country, and the presidency have been put through the ringer by this supposedly great God and the crooked angels who let this hoax happen,” said the president, boasting that his approval rating was far higher than the Lord’s would ever be while holding aloft a copy ofThe Washington Post’s front-page “Trump acquitted” headline and quipping that the Almighty did not seem so all-powerful anymore. “Honestly, folks, this is a very dishonest and corrupt creator we’re talking about. He says He loves everybody, but He’s really a fool and a liar. Frankly, our maker never should have been given the power to create the Universe, let alone pull the strings to humiliate me in front of the entire country. Hate to say it, but it’s true.” At press time, the gathering of Christian preachers and prayer groups gave Trump a thunderous standing ovation after the president said that the Lord could eat shit and he was looking forward to when His Holiness finally died."
685,"MANCHESTER, NH—In a last-minute attempt to court the much-sought-after demographic, Senator Bernie Sanders appealed to a town hall of moderates Thursday by reminding them all of his policies would wind up getting watered down enough to match their positions anyway. “Listen, I understand many of you are nervous about my so-called radical stances on healthcare and abolishing ICE, but I’d urge you to remember they will ultimately be so diluted by the political process and left so utterly toothless that none of you could possibly oppose the end result,” said Sanders, assuring the center-left voters that since two-thirds of all Senate Democrats are on the record as not backing his Medicare For All proposal, even placing it on his website was at best wishful thinking compared to the sort of slight incremental progress that his White House would realistically be able to enact. “Let’s be honest here: Based on the center-leaning composition of Congress and where we stand ideologically as a country, my administration would be very lucky to even get a public option on the books. So what I’m saying here is don’t worry. By the time the lobbyists get through with gutting my platform, it’ll only be palatable to ineffectual middle-of-the-road voters like yourselves.” At press time, Sanders had received a standing ovation from the gathering after he closed his speech by noting that many of his far-left supporters would likely end up despising him for the compromises he would be forced to make as president."
686,"AKRON, OH—As President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial ended with an acquittal in the Senate, sources confirmed Friday that both parties acting exactly how everyone expected them to had restored the nation’s faith in its political process. “Watching the Democrats cower behind ineffectual high-minded rhetoric while the Republicans manipulated every procedure and spouted dangerous propaganda really affirmed my belief that today’s U.S. government is working exactly as intended,” said 43-year-old retail manager Aaron Bennett, echoing the sentiments of 325 million Americans who confirmed that although the impeachment trial had shaken their faith in their leaders, watching the Democrats belatedly pursue a narrow goal that resisted meaningfully challenging any structural issues, only to let themselves be easily obstructed by Republican leaders committed to holding power regardless of the consequences, offered sorely needed reassurance of the strength of the U.S. political system. “I was really worried impeachment indicated that the American way of life for the last several decades was at risk. I admit I even doubted whether our institutions could survive several Republicans deviating from their cynical embrace of an obvious criminal in order to further their callous agenda. The idea that Democrats were actually trying to pursue a moral objective instead of just using moral rhetoric as a smokescreen for accumulating influence really shook me. I’m just grateful that both parties were able to move past their differences and work together to uphold the American political system as we know it.” The relieved nation added that it would have been devastating if the Senate removed Trump, which would fly in the face of what the founding fathers wanted when they inscribed the principle of a few rich men shielding each other from accountability into the nation’s Constitution."
687,"WASHINGTON—Saying his initial enthusiasm had faded after learning about the award’s history, conservative radio personality Rush Limbaugh conceded Wednesday that receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom was less of an honor knowing it had been bestowed upon Rosa Parks and Maya Angelou, too. “While I understand this medal represents the highest civilian honor possible, I was a bit disconcerted to discover this morning that I share this distinction with both a civil rights icon and a poet who gave a voice to black Americans,” said Limbaugh, who explained that he hopes people don’t doubt his integrity as he joins the ranks of the award’s previous recipients, especially Cicely Tyson, Ralph Ellison, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Stevie Wonder, and Willie Mays. “I almost sent it back. But instead I have decided to keep my Medal of Freedom and let it stand as a testament to my willingness to tolerate others. I hope my acceptance of it will go some way toward reclaiming this honor from the Martin Luther Kings and Nelson Mandelas of the world.” At press time, Limbaugh confirmed he felt more confident that the award meant something after learning it had also been given to Henry Kissinger and Strom Thurmond."
688,"WASHINGTON—Hoping the yellow, graphite-based writing instrument would allay voter doubts following the chaos of the Iowa caucuses, the Democratic National Committee reportedly offered a technology startup $500 million Tuesday to develop a pencil that can accurately record election results. “As of this morning, we have commissioned the design and manufacture of a cutting-edge tabulation device that will be able to legibly report vote totals on a sheet of paper 99% of the time,” said DNC chair Tom Perez, holding up a rough prototype of the 7.5-inch hexagonal marking implement, which will be built and rigorously stress-tested by a new Silicon Valley business venture known as Sharpen. “It may not be easy to encase a cylinder of graphite with wood or put a slick coat of glossy paint on its outside. But with this new partnership, we believe we will soon have at our disposal a pencil that is both reliable and totally resistant to any attack by foreign powers. Also, because it can be sharpened, this new delegate-reporting tool can be used repeatedly, lasting us through New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, and perhaps even Super Tuesday.” At press time, sources confirmed plans for the pencil had been scrapped after election security experts warned the rubber eraser on its tip would quickly erode public trust in the product."
689,"WASHINGTON—Claiming the 89-year-old woman’s numerous blunders had caused the delay to the state’s results, Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez told reporters Tuesday that all problems with the Iowa Caucus could be blamed on a single fuck-up senior citizen volunteer. “What it comes down to is that this costly and embarrassing mistake can be traced to one elderly volunteer named Muriel Luntz,” said Perez, adding that the party had hesitated on whether to release details about the Dubuque-based widow and five-time election volunteer, but ultimately decided to do so based on the gravity of Luntz’s empty-headed missteps in singlehandedly derailing the first-in-the-nation caucus. “Obviously, I don’t want to speculate, but I don’t think this woman is all there upstairs anymore. That’s the only way I could imagine someone bungling our exceptional election security measures. It’s a shame that just one numbskull could blemish the DNC’s sterling record. So let me just say that I completely hear the outpouring of frustration from voters and want them to know that any of their outrage should be sent directly to her home address, which we’ll be releasing online soon.” Perez also pledged that as an effort to tamp down on further mistakes, he would ensure that by the next election, the idiotic octagenarian would no longer be alive."
690,"WASHINGTON—As the beginning of primary season upped the stakes in their search for an alternative candidate, Democratic National Committee officials reportedly mulled Monday asking Donald Trump to run for president as a Democrat in an effort to stop Bernie Sanders. “He’s obviously not our first choice, but Trump has a track record of winning elections, not to mention he does well with the conservative voters we’ll need to swing some red states blue—if that’s who we need to ask to ensure Bernie doesn’t win, we’ll do it,” said DNC chairman Tom Perez, who had circled Trump’s name on a white board lising dozens of potential candidates the party could try to convince to jump into the Democratic Party primaries in order to obstruct a Sanders nomination. “This late in the game, we need somebody with name recognition and a built-in following, which Trump definitely has. He has political experience working with Republicans, which will help him win over moderate voters who are turned off by the idea of a socialist president. Plus, he’ll have the backing of the Democratic donor base, who generally prefer him to Sanders. Look, sometimes politics makes strange bedfellows, but I think I speak for party leadership when I say that we’d much rather see Donald Trump than Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.” At press time, Perez was in negotiations to ensure Trump was on every Democratic primary ballot for Super Tuesday and changing the requirements to allow Trump to qualify for the next Democratic debate."
691,"WASHINGTON—Confirming the challenges associated with preserving liberal democracy, the nation’s top political scientists issued a report Friday that found fighting against the rising tide of authoritarianism sounds like a ton of work. “After extensive analysis, we can state with a high degree of certainty that meaningfully resisting the erosion of equality and personal freedoms would probably be super exhausting,” said lead researcher Jeremy Dwyer, warning that stemming the flow of autocratic rule would require a sustained campaign of political pressure over a long period of time that would likely make Americans tired just to think about. “Whether it’s attending protests, campaigning for progressive candidates, or even committing to ethical purchasing habits, our data show that engaging at this level would be a whole thing that could eat up a bunch of time. The majority of American citizens are very sleepy and want to get back to their beds as soon as possible. Plus, this all sounds kind of like a big pain in the ass.” Dwyer added that the report concluded it would be so much easier to simply march in unthinking lockstep to an all-powerful ruler."
692,"OTTUMWA, IA—As part of his effort to reinvigorate the coalition that once put Barack Obama in the White House, presidential candidate Joe Biden issued a moving plea for party unity when he told a Democratic voter “You’re a piece of shit and I hope everyone like you dies,” reports confirmed Thursday. “Look here, pal, fuck you and fuck anybody who thinks like you,” the former vice president said to a town hall participant in what political experts have hailed as a rousing call for Democrats, independents, and even moderate Republicans to join together in harmony and overcome the divisiveness and rancor that have characterized the Trump era. “If that’s what you believe, you’re clearly an idiot, and I don’t need your vote. Seriously, you and every single person in this fucking town deserves to die. Now back the hell up before I tear your throat out with my goddamn teeth.” After the event, a screaming, red-faced Biden reportedly continued to share his inspiring vision by informing a group of unwitting Iowans that he could beat their asses with one hand tied behind his back."

The Palestinians will be given every opportunity to swim and splash around as long as they don’t attempt to impede on Israeli sovereignty by trying to crawl out of the water or wash up on the beach.” Kushner added that as a further concession to the Palestinain people, the plan would include a four-year freeze before Israelis could annex the Mediterranean and drive the Palestinians into the Atlantic Ocean."

It pains me to see so many op-ed writers out there who have received so little training or education that they have no capacity to do viable work. But I believe that these op-ed writers and editorial board members want to be productive members of society, and my presidency will do everything it can to help them find work with dignity.” Sanders added that it was an unfortunate result of the U.S. economic system that so many Americans found themselves stuck in low-skilled op-ed writing jobs in the first place."

At every town hall back in my inverted ether, my constituents come to slice my eyeball, which I understand as a sign that impeachment doesn’t enjoy broad support.

703,"WASHINGTON—Speaking to thousands of March For Life protesters assembled on the National Mall, President Donald Trump took to the stage Friday to make a powerful pro-life case about the joys of neglecting a child. “Of course, I’m a father, and I had my thoughts about terminating them all, but I’m standing before you today to tell you that I’m glad I didn’t because I would never have gotten to experience the simple but incredible pleasures of pawning them off on the help for the first decade or so of their lives,” said Trump, defending the anti-abortion movement with a stirring speech about how profoundly being an absent and indifferent father had affected his life. “I wish I could describe to you how good it feels to avoid every soccer game and piano recital, and how incredible it’s been watching them grow from a child I couldn’t care less about to an adult I barely know. Whether it’s Ivanka, Don Jr., or one of the other two, they’ve each been a blessing that I never would have known if they had been aborted.” Trump went on to bring several audience members to tears by describing in detail the moment he first realized he’d be able to bully and emotionally terrorize his children forever."
704,"WASHINGTON—Denouncing his predecessor’s water regulations as overly restrictive, President Donald Trump announced Thursday he was lifting protections enacted by the Obama administration to permanently entomb Gangthor the Malevolent in a murky trench deep below the Pacific Ocean. “These horrible rules created by Barack Obama are one of the worst examples of government overreach in our nation’s history, and they are totally unfair to the deadly leviathan known as Gangthor,” said Trump, who was later overheard muttering ancient incantations reportedly intended to loosen the cursèd chains that shackle the nefarious shadow-behemoth to the ocean floor. “I will personally swim to the bottom of the Pacific and use a golden key inscribed with mysterious runes to unlock Gangthor’s lair, where he has slumbered since the destructive Clean Water Rule of 2015 was issued. This shape-shifting, multi-tentacled monster will then once more be unleashed upon the waters of the United States, restoring the property rights of American farmers, fossil fuel companies, and real estate developers.” The president went on to criticize “prophets of doom” who have predicted Gangthor the Malevolent will rise in a column of smoke and fire upon his release, blocking out the sun and blighting the earth with a thousand years of darkness."
705,"WASHINGTON—After he gaveled the Senate to order Wednesday afternoon, Chief Justice John Roberts sternly admonished both President Trump’s counsel and House impeachment managers to remember they were participating in a complete farce of a trial. “As you address members of this deliberative body, please bear in mind that nothing you say or do will have any effect on the completely predetermined outcome of these proceedings,” said Roberts, exhorting the two sides to go ahead and establish facts, promulgate lies, cite the Constitution, or engage in purely cynical bad-faith arguments, because none of it really mattered anyway. “I wish to remind you this trial is a hollow exercise of decorum with no possibility of achieving productive results of any kind. We’re just going through the motions here, we all know how it is going to end, so let’s at least try to keep it brief.” At press time, the chief justice had commended both sides for heeding his admonition and working to keep the monumental miscarriage of justice running smoothly."
706,"WASHINGTON—Over the objections of Democrats who decried the measure as not receiving sufficient debate on the congressional floor, Senate Republicans forced through a resolution Wednesday establishing Wingstop as the official sponsor of President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial. “Resolved that effective immediately, all questions, witness statements, and other utterances must include a recommendation to eat at Wingstop, and the Wingstop logo must be clearly visible on all name placards, subpoenaed documents, and other written material,” read Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) from the resolution on the Senate floor, adding that Wingstop’s $25 million deal to sponsor the impeachment trial was the best offer Congress received and ignoring pleas from Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to wait for Panera Bread to finalize its proposal. “This resolution also stipulates that each senator must be photographed with Wingstop’s lemon pepper wings on each day of the trial as part of our promotion, all social media posts about the impeachment must be accompanied with the #RightWingstop hashtag, and that the only food permitted in the chamber will be Wingstop wing combos with fries or veggie sticks and a 20-ounce soft drink. This is in order to ensure the impeachment trial remains a place where flavor gets its wings. Democracy works best when we’re full of chicken.” The resolution did make an exception, however, for Chief Justice John Roberts, who informed the Senate that the Wingstop contract could not apply to him, as he has an exclusive sponsorship with Buffalo Wild Wings."
707,"NEW YORK—In a dramatic challenge of the editorial board,The New York Timestravel section broke with the paper Tuesday to endorse former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick for the Democratic nomination. “Given his impressive track record as a card-carrying Hyatt Loyalty Program member and the only candidate with TSA PreCheck, we are left no choice but to split with the main body of this organization and endorse Deval Patrick,” said travel editor Amy Virshup, explaining that the section’s values have been diverging from the rest of the newspaper for years and thatThe Time’s co-endorsement of Klobuchar and Warren did not reflect the values of American jet-setters nearly as well as Patrick. “Patrick thoroughly impressed us with his comprehensive plan for the best way to spend 36hours in Marrakech, and proved he’s ready to lead with his extensive knowledge of everything from using concierge services to where to find the best bar in the Seattle area. Whether you prefer a family vacation or a romantic getaway, for the conscientious traveler, there is no better candidate than Deval Patrick.” At press time, an emergent Deval Patrick had picked up endorsements from every major American newspaper’s travel section."
708,"WASHINGTON—Praising the civil rights leader for his determination and commitment to justice, Kellyanne Conway, senior counselor to the president, suggested to reporters Monday that Martin Luther King Jr. would have traveled to Ukraine for dirt on Joe Biden. “Dr. Martin Luther King, who was known for his nonviolent tactics, including protests and community organizing, would certainly have traveled abroad to pressure foreign nations to expose a political enemy’s secrets,” said Conway, who explained that if King were alive today, he would without a doubt hop on a flight to Kiev to meet with Ukrainian government officials to acquire potentially damaging information about Biden’s younger son, Hunter. “While much of the United States remains divided, Dr. King had a brave and bold vision hinged on withholding aid from Ukraine for personal political purposes. He understood that civil disobedience is essential in fighting a corrupt system, so he wasn’t afraid to spend the night in jail or do a littlequid pro quo. In fact, some of his most famous tweets were written from jail.” Conway added that it was a shame such a great civil rights leader had been impeached so young."
709,"WASHINGTON—Hastily concealing the “super top secret” shelter’s entrance with a couch cushion, the Trump boys reportedly declared “They can’t impeach someone they can’t see” Friday while cramming their dad into a homemade bunker under the Oval Office desk. “The House peach managers [sic] are never, ever gonna be able to find dad way deep in here!” said Donald Trump Jr., who stapled a note with the message “definitely no president inside” to blankets as an extra security precaution while Eric Trump punched air holes through the pillows with a pair of scissors. “Stay right there, dad, and don’t move till 2050. We read through the whole constant tuition [sic] and it says those guys can’t impeach you if they can’t find you. Here are two pieces of bread for dinners, and a straw you can use as a snorkel. Close your eyes real tight and you’ll be totally invisible. Okay, see you later. We’re gonna glue the bunker door shut.” At press time, the Trump boys were panicking after realizing they’d lost their father."
710,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that their duty to uphold the Constitution required impartiality in their role as jurors, Republican senators told reporters Friday that they would weigh all evidence before lifting President Donald Trump into the air and carrying him outside on their shoulders. “Look, as senators, we swore a solemn oath to deliver justice, and I intend to abide by that precisely as we use this trial to scrutinize the facts and then determine exactly how—and indeed, if—we will storm into the Oval Office, hoist the delighted president aloft, and regale him with spirited rounds of ‘Hip, hip, hurray,’” said Sen. Mitch McConnell, noting that his awesome responsibility as the chamber’s majority leader required him to tamp down on any partisan speculation on whether Senate Republicans would rush to raise the president up onto their shoulders while singing “He’s A Jolly Good Fellow” or if Senate Republicans would opt for a more stately procession in which they conveyed the recently acquitted Trump past each and every Democratic congressperson’s office. “Unlike some of my liberal colleagues, I understand my solemn role in this trial is to examine all the information at hand before passing judgment. Then, and only then, can we know whether it’s a reasonable course of action to deploy some form of red-white-and-blue confetti while repeatedly tossing President Trump into the air. Until then, it would simply be irresponsible to comment on whether or not we will incorporate party horns, noisemakers, or a big cake covered with lit sparklers into the proceedings.” At press time, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin had commended McConnell on his commitment to impartiality as they came to a swift conclusion on whether or not they should cue up Kool and the Gang’s “Celebration” on the Senate’s speaker system."
711,"WASHINGTON—Calling their bombshell report incredibly damning, CNN revealed Thursday that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders has been knowingly running a campaign to become president of a country with a long history of sexism. “This new evidence proves beyond a doubt that Bernie Sanders strongly wants to lead a nation that has repeatedly enabled, supported, and encouraged misogyny,” said Anderson Cooper in a breaking news segment, claiming to have several documents directly linking Sanders to a country that did not even allow women to vote until the 20th century. “Right here is a transcript of the text this woman-hating country was founded upon, a country which he willfully lives in and has publicly sworn an oath to, mind you. On just the first page it explicitly declares that all men are created equal, with absolutely no mention of women. And down here—look closely at these signatures that ratified this document as the supreme law of the land. You guessed it, all men.” At press time, CNN confirmed that Sanders had not yet denied his close ties to this country nor its tens of millions of residents with deeply ingrained biases against women."
712,"WASHINGTON—After learning that Ukraine police had opened an investigation into whether associates of the president had surveilled the diplomat in Kyiv last year, White House senior advisor Stephen Miller was reportedly upset Thursday at being passed over for a job stalking female U.S. ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. “When I found out that some of Giuliani’s goons had been tailing the ambassador around Ukraine, my heart just sank—I mean, how could they decide to follow a lady around and not pick me to do the job?” said Miller, who added that after all the thankless tasks he had performed for the Trump administration over three-plus years in office, he figured he would be at the top of the list when a plum gig like stalking a woman on the administration’s behalf came along. “If I had known there was an opening for shadowing an important lady, I would’ve absolutely thrown my hat in the ring. Maybe I got passed over because I’m already stalking a bunch of women here in the U.S., but I still would’ve been able to manage my time and make it work. It really hurts that they didn’t even bother to ask. It would be one thing if I didn’t have any experience in tracking women without them knowing, but I’m really good at it. I can keep quiet in an alleyway, or stay awake idling in the car, or huddle in a closet without a peep for hours. And I’m really good at gathering hair and undergarments. I just wish they’d given me a chance.” At press time, Miller had decided to cheer himself up by lying below the former ambassador’s bed wearing her clothing while she was asleep."
713,"DES MOINES, IA—Emphasizing that the leaked recording would clear up any confusion about the various crunching, slurping, and gurgling sounds heard after the Iowa Democratic Debate, CNN released a wet mic audio analysis Thursday that revealed Joe Biden had been caught chewing on his own microphone. “While at first, the recording only picks up Biden shaking hands and joking with his fellow candidates, we eventually hear him tapping on the mic and whispering, ‘Oh, what is this? Come to papa,’” said CNN audio engineer Kristen Jennings, adding that the former vice president can then be heard sniffing the lavalier, licking it once, and then sticking it directly into his mouth. “After hours of analysis, our team has determined that Biden then attempted to chew the mic before saying ‘ew’ and spitting it out onto the ground. Then, a few minutes later, he decided to pick it back up, pop it back into his mouth, chew it, and ultimately, swallow it.” At press time, CNN confirmed that the microphone’s audio had also picked up ample evidence that Biden had successfully passed the mic two days later."
714,"WASHINGTON—Backtracking in light of recent polls that indicate public dismay over his handling of Iran, President Trump announced Wednesday he was moving forward with a plan to reverse the killing of top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani. “I have overturned the decision to assassinate Gen. Soleimani and ordered our military to rescind the Jan. 3 drone strike that destroyed his convoy at Baghdad International Airport,” said Trump, who explained the move would revoke Soleimani’s status as a Shiite martyr and decrease the likelihood of the United States being drawn into an unpopular war with Iran. “The U.S. Air Force operation that killed the general was conducted without the consent of Congress and, more significantly, without the backing of the American people. So today our forces in the region will take immediate action to return Soleimani to his family unexploded. This doesn’t mean we won’t take him out in a future operation if surveys indicate a majority of swing-state voters approve of such an action, but for now we will allow him to resume command of the Quds Force.” The president added that he has yet to see any polls that would convince him to retract his October decision to let Turkey kill hundreds of Kurdish civilians in Syria."
715,"DES MOINES, IA—Cutting off his chief strategist midway through a daily meeting to express his unwillingness to continue the deception much longer, former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly asked advisors Wednesday how much longer he has to go through the routine of acting confused and doddering in order to avoid criticism. “Please, guys, I’m so tired of putting on this whole song-and-dance of stumbling over my words at every public appearance and painfully wincing so it seems like I’ve completely forgotten a foreign leader’s name,” said the presumptive frontrunner, looking at each and every one of his advisors with clear, thoughtful eye contact, while stressing that although his consistent lead in polling showed the strategy had worked spectacularly to shield him from any critique of his record, he also longed to drop this “entire frail-old-man act” and speak to audiences in full sentences that allowed him to robustly articulate his vision for restoring America’s soul. “Just give me a date when I can start fully enunciating my words in TV spots. That’s all. Obviously, I can keep doing the simple stuff like biting my wife’s finger or challenging audience members to push-up contests seemingly out of nowhere. I know you think that’s helpful. I get that it would sink me in the polls if I were held accountable for past statements and actions, but frankly it’s just exhausting to be constantly acting this mentally confused when I know I can be so much stronger out there.” At press time, Biden was begging his advisors to at least never again make him punch himself midway through a debate to give the appearance of his eye filling up with blood."
716,"Economic sanctions, in which a country levies financial penalties against another country, entity, or person, are at the center of tense U.S.–Iran relations, and their use in general is a matter of significant debate.The Onionlooks at the pros and cons of economic sanctions. Something to say you tried before starting the war you were planning anyway. Shows populace consequences for insisting on being born powerless in dictatorship. More difficult to quantify deaths they cause than straight-up war. Just nice to have something to announce every once in a while. Only harms people without power to retaliate. Innocent money drawn into other parties’ conflict. Probably involve at least some math. Damn it. We wanted to travel there one day. Shit. Denies thousands of citizens sweet taste of Pepsi Max. Not as satisfying to invade country whose citizens already sick and starving to death."
717,"BETTENDORF, IOWA—Shivering and shouting for help as his plan to find his supporters went awry, presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was reportedly trapped in a walk-in freezer Thursday after searching an Iowa diner for its back room with high-rolling donors. “Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? I don’t understand where my donors are if they’re not in this cooler,” said Buttigieg, who had reportedly breezed through the diner, ignoring its clientele, before asking a line cook where the back room with all the wealthy campaign funders was located, getting frustrated at the man’s confusion, and deciding to find it himself by searching for a hidden passageway as the freezer door locked behind him. “I don’t understand—it’s usually right here. They have to hide in the back so we can meet in secret outside the prying eyes of the media and all the poor people. Where is the manager? Why on earth would I enter a rinky-dink joint just to hobnob with a bunch of people eating scrambled eggs and getting five bucks for my trouble when I know there’s a cushy hidden back room where I can talk to voters who matter over a glass of champagne? Jesus Christ, where’s [spokesperson] Lis [Smith] when I need her? I don’t know what I’m going to do. I already called for help in eight languages, and I’m starting to get really cold.” At press time, Buttigieg had resorted to doing his campaign’s “High Hopes” dance in an effort to stay warm."
718,"DES MOINES, IA—Reaffirming their commitment to facilitating a civil, constructive event, CNN moderators reminded Democratic debate participants Tuesday to keep personal attacks off the stage in favor of the new confessional cam backstage. “We want to have an honest discussion about policies and positions, so if you have any vicious insults or cheap shots you want to take, we ask that you hold back until we have you mic’d up and sitting somewhere cushy,” said moderator Wolf Blitzer, who added that in the offhand chance candidates didn’t have anything negative to say, a CNN producer would be able to assist them by offering them a glass of champagne or shot of tequila and some helpful prompts. “Verbal abuse will not be tolerated on the debate stage, but if you want to call Pete Buttigieg a spineless little bitch in front of the confession cam, we ask that you please go off. Voters have an important choice to make, so we ask that you let any unpleasant feelings build up inside of you until you have the opportunity to get backstage and explode. Crying for an hour and then falling asleep in front of the confession cam is simply standard debate etiquette.” Blitzer added that the footage would be shared in a two-hour-long special following the debate."
719,"DES MOINES, IA—In light of the Democratic presidential candidate’s alleged comments on the electiblity of a female candidate, CNN debate moderator Wolf Blitzer challenged Bernie Sanders Tuesday to prove his support for women by accurately naming each part of the female reproductive system. “All of them—you have 30 seconds,” said Blitzer, gesturing toward an unlabeled anatomical diagram of the female reproductive organs. “As a progressive candidate, this is your opportunity to show your advocacy for women’s rights once and for all by listing every part of the female genitalia, internal and external, in alphabetical order and then from largest to smallest. Don’t forget any of the ligaments or blood vessels.” At press time, Sanders attempted to transition to discussing policy before being cut off and forced to draw the vulva."
720,"DES MOINES, IA—Speculating that the candidate would not raise an objection to any sum they named, CNN officials reported Tuesday that they figured the network could soak Tom Steyer for a few million simply by pretending that it costs money to appear in that evening’s debate. “Here’s what I’m thinking: We just rattle off an email to Tom’s campaign mentioning that we hadn’t gotten his $2.5 million debate fee, see if any of his staffers bat an eye, and then take things from there,” said CNN president Jeff Zucker, noting that his team had already received prompt and courteous payment from Steyer’s campaign after sending them an itemized list suggesting the network required reimbursement for the candidate’s podium and microphone alongside a per-question fee for Wolf Blitzer’s time. “Early on, I told one of his chief aides that we were going to bill them for every word he uttered, and he just nodded and said ‘uh-huh, sounds good.’ God, he was actually surprised that we were charging them so much less than PBS had at the last debate.” At press time, Steyer was spotted frantically searching his suit pockets after a stage tech informed the businessman that he had failed to compensate the network with $500 for its customary entrance fee."
721,"DES MOINES, IA—Following the New Jersey senator’s decision to end his bid for the White House, sources confirmed Tuesday that without Cory Booker’s message of love and unity to hold it together, a bloody wave of chaos and rage had spread through the Democratic presidential field. According to eyewitnesses, absent Booker’s ideals of sympathy for those with different viewpoints and compassion for one’s political enemies, a series of violent attacks erupted among the candidates, with Joe Biden taking a tire iron to a campaign bus Pete Buttigieg had driven at full speed through a group of the former vice president’s canvassers. The sudden lack of caring and cooperation in the political atmosphere also reportedly led Amy Klobuchar to drag Andrew Yang by the hair through the streets of Des Moines, kick the entrepreneur unconscious, and throw him into a river. At press time, Mike Bloomberg is said to have responded to the primary race’s new climate by going door-to-door and pistol-whipping dozens of working-class Iowans until they agreed to vote for him."
722,"DES MOINES—Responding to accusations by members of the Elizabeth Warren campaign that he told her in a 2018 conversation that he didn’t believe a woman could win the presidency, the Bernie Sanders campaign doubled down Tuesday with a new television ad warning Americans that they’ll never be able to hear a female president over the sound of her vacuum. “I do not believe that we as Americans can risk electing a female candidate who won’t address universal healthcare or climate change over the loud racket of her vacuum cleaner coming from the Oval Office 24 hours a day,” said Sanders over an ominous 30-second black-and-white shot of panicked advisors fleeing a national security meeting when the female president, a woman with a beehive hairdo, high heels, and an apron, accidentally filled the room with thick smoke after burning a pan of cookies in the briefing room oven. “When you make your decision about the Democratic nominee, consider whether you want a president who is divided between making policy decisions and scrubbing the floors, or trying to take care of our veterans when she’s preoccupied with her crying baby. Not to mention the hair dryer whirring all day and night as the lady president does her hair. And how does she expect to keep America safe when she’s constantly distracting our top generals by asking them for help opening difficult jars? Maybe we as a nation will be ready for a female president in 2024, if technology has improved so that vacuums are quieter, but until then we can’t afford to take the chance.” The Warren campaign reportedly responded with a fundraising email stating that the candidate was disappointed that Sanders had called her every single day since 2016 to say that women should never be allowed in public without a male escort but that she didn’t want to discuss the matter further and risk being divisive."
723,"DES MOINES, IA—Praising the former South Bend, IN mayor as a “true champion” of nothing in particular, local swing voter Chris Fernsby told reporters Tuesday he felt a deep connection with presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg’s complete lack of conviction. “As a generally noncommittal person without any firm ideas about how our government should be run, I can see a lot of myself in this up-and-coming young leader with no discernible political identity,” said Fernsby, who added that Buttigieg’s vague but carefully focus-grouped positions on Medicare for All and police reform perfectly captured his own indecisive and shifting mindset when it came to issues at stake in the 2020 election. “Do I have strong views on affordable housing or how much public college tuition should cost? No. But you know what? Neither does Pete Buttigieg. When I listen to his uplifting, substance-free rhetoric, the only thing I can tell for sure is that he really, really wants to be president. And that’s good enough for me!” Fernsby went on to add that while he intended to support Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination, he still planned to vote for President Trump in the general election."
724,"ALGONA, IA—Sitting in the diner where he now eats breakfast every morning, Senator Cory Booker announced Monday that he was dropping out of the 2020 rat race after falling in love with small-town Iowa life. “I’ve spent my whole life worrying about my career, chasing the next big position, but after spending all this time in Iowa, I’ve realized it’s community and family that count,” said Booker, who revealed he’s taken a position at the local auto parts store, bought a cute little ranch house, and started volunteering at a nursing home. “The air is fresher, the people are nicer, and everyone knows your name. I’ve found peace here. I was working my ass off every day, and for what? To be president of the United States? To pass some immigration plan? That stuff doesn’t matter. I just want a quiet garden and people who love me.” Booker added that while girlfriend Rosario Dawson was thinking about moving in, she was more interested in a place with a little more hustle and bustle like Fort Dodge."
725,"CAROL STREAM, IL—In a scathing opinion piece published Thursday byChristianity Today, the evangelical magazine’s editor-in-chief Mark Galli made the case for President Trump’s removal from the Holy Trinity. “The president has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the ethical convictions necessary for us to continue worshipping him as a part of the triune God,” said Galli, explaining that when Trump was seated at the right hand of the Father, many Christians assumed his behavior would by extension be righteous and godly, but this has not been the case. “While it is not a decision we undertake lightly, our position is firm: If we do not reverse course now—if we continue to accept Mr. Trump as our Lord and Savior in spite of his blackened moral record—who will take the evangelical community seriously in the years to come?” Galli’s editorial goes on to reassure readers the magazine supports the deification of Vice President Pence, who in the event of Trump’s removal would ascend to a place alongside the Father and the Holy Spirit."
726,"LOS ANGELES—In response to criticism that its threshold for participation has reduced the diversity on stage, the Democratic National Committee announced it would increase ethnic representation in Thursday night’s debate by allowing New York governor Andrew Cuomo to take part. “We heard loud and clear from Democratic voters how important it is to have a panel of debaters that reflects the diverse fabric of America, and so we’re grateful to Gov. Cuomo for agreeing to join tonight’s event on such short notice,” said DNC spokesperson Philip Aldridge, adding that now more than ever it was vital for Democrats to show they are the party of all Americans, whether they be white, Sicilian, Sardinian, or even Venetian. “Inclusion is at the heart of everything the DNC strives for, and Italian Americans are a group that, especially if you look back at the late 19th and early 20th centuries, has been historically underrepresented in positions of power. What better way to show that the Democratic Party truly cares about people of color?” At press time, DNC officials had confirmed that due to space restrictions, Cuomo would be given Andrew Yang’s podium at the debate."
727,"WASHINGTON—In response to the presidential candidate’s criticism of the party’s current rules that have left him unqualified for tonight’s Democratic debate, the DNC announced Thursday that they have eased the debate requirements to 0.1% above whatever number Cory Booker was polling. “We’ve considered Senator Booker’s comments and have agreed to change the overly stringent prerequisites to include those candidates who poll just a fraction of a percentage above him,” said DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that these less strict qualifications would be tied to a constantly sliding scale contingent on how Senator Booker’s campaign was doing at any point during the race, opening up the debate stage to a more inclusive group of Democrats who had low polling numbers that were still higher than Booker’s. “We’ve also taken the extra step of adjusting the number of necessary donations from 200,000 unique donors to whatever number makes Booker come up just shy of qualifying. We want to thank Senator Booker for pointing out this injustice after he learned that he would not be eligible for the upcoming debate, and we hope that this compromise satisfies Senator Booker’s request.” Perez added that the threshold may be relaxed even more to allow any Democratic candidate still in the race onto the debate stage after Cory Booker drops out."
728,"WASHINGTON—Clarifying controversial remarks he made about the deceased Michigan lawmaker last night, Donald Trump told reporters Thursday he can confirm the late congressman John Dingell is in hell because of the window into a terrifying inferno the president sees every time he closes his eyes. “Each night, when I lie down in bed, I feel the heat of eternal flames and hear the screams of the damned,” said Trump, explaining that he has gazed into the hideous abyss and seen Satan himself feasting upon the maggot-infested corpse of the long-serving former representative. “John’s definitely down there along with all the other poor souls crying out to be released from ceaseless torment. He’s always whispering that the fate awaiting me will be far, far worse than his, beyond anything I could possibly comprehend. Why do you think I barely sleep?” Members of the White House press pool were then seen running from the briefing room as the blood drained from the president’s face, his eyes rolled back in his head, and, using an inhumanly deep, guttural voice, he began to mutter strange incantations in Latin."
729,"WASHINGTON—Warning that allowing them to vote without proper documentation would undermine the sanctity of the democratic process, the House GOP turned away dozens of Democrats from impeaching President Donald Trump Wednesday after determining they did not have adequate voter ID. “This is simply a precautionary measure to make sure that these individuals are, in fact, real U.S. representatives who would be eligible to engage in this process,” said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), telling reporters that he had been forced to prevent numerous members, including John Lewis, Maxine Waters, and James Clyburn, from entering the congressional chamber since they had not been able to show two forms of government-issued identification, as well as a utility bill, to establish residency. “Yes, providing adequate ID is a little annoying, but without oversight, these so-called members of Congress could run amok, voting in multiple districts and leading to a fraudulent impeachment. We simply cannot allow this to happen, so if we come across any representatives who appear suspicious, it’s imperative we make sure they’re thoroughly scrutinized.” Gaetz added that in order to relieve exhausted congressional staffers, impeachment voting had closed several hours early."
730,"WASHINGTON—Looking around the chamber for some sort of food station, Congressman Don Young (R-AK) told reporters Wednesday that he could’ve sworn the last impeachment hearing he attended was catered. “When we were impeaching Clinton in the ’90s, I’m pretty sure there was a whole spread with, like, soups and sandwiches and a prime rib carving station,” said a peckish Young, explaining that he purposefully didn’t bring lunch today because he assumed the House of Representatives would be providing them with a buffet. “I asked an aide where the grub was, and she told me she could order food for me but I’d have to pay for it—can you believe it? I mean, not even a make-your-own pasta bar for exercising our constitutional duties. At the very least, they could have provided us with some danishes or something.” When it was representative Young’s turn to have the floor, sources confirmed he delivered an impassioned diatribe blasting the lack of free food."
731,"HAMDEN, CT—According to a new poll out Wednesday from Quinnipiac University, 54% of Americans approve of President Trump receiving the death penalty, but believe his transgressions have not risen to a level that warrants removal from office. “While nearly all survey participants agreed the president should be executed in a highly public setting, only a minority thinks he should receive a proper burial, with more than half stating that the deceased commander-in-chief should be allowed to complete his four-year term,” said polling analyst Rebecca Glenski, explaining that the results indicate an unwillingness among Americans to effectively overturn the outcome of a presidential election. “Of that 54%, approximately two-thirds said that after he is put to death—preferably by hanging, beheading, or crucifixion—Trump should not only remain in the Oval Office but also be permitted to appear at public events, attend official White House functions, and have a seat at global summits like the G7. In addition, most respondents strongly indicated the president’s corpse should stand for re-election next year so the people can decide whether to remove his earthly remains from office.” Polling suggests in 2020 the bloated, lifeless body of Trump would continue to enjoy a strong, built-in advantage in the Electoral College."
732,"WASHINGTON—Praising bipartisan efforts that prevented a government shutdown ahead of the holiday season, Congress reportedly reached a $1.4 trillion spending deal Tuesday to award the entire budget to one lucky American. “This is going to provide a completely new life for a single and very, very fortunate American,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, explaining that anyone who pays taxes is eligible to win except for employees and family members of those working for the federal government. “We were happy to see both sides step up and make concessions, including the size of the novelty check, who will pull the balls from the raffle drum, and the decision to eliminate the Social Security and Medicare programs. Winners can spend the money on whatever they like, and have the choice between receiving a lump sum or annuity payments of a billion dollars over the next thousand years or so. Second and third place winners will receive a 10-speed bike and $10 Amazon gift certificate respectively.” At press time, sources confirmed that this is only the third time the U.S. government has held such a lottery, which is credited to creating both the Carnegie and Rockefeller fortunes."
733,"NEWARK—Referring to the “surefire” system as a sort of pyramid of communication, Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker excitedly walked long-term girlfriend and actress Rosario Dawson through his new network-based strategy to distribute campaign newsletters, sources confirmed Monday. “And then when those people share it, the 144 turns into over 20,000 people reading, and by the end of the month? That’s the whole country!” said a wild-eyed, energized Booker as he paced in front of Dawson, who told the New Jersey senator through a tight smile that it sounded like a great idea. “Ever since we had to cut staff in New Hampshire, my brain’s just been working overtime. I can’t believe how easy it is! The trick is to get a teacher or something to email it to parents of the kids, then you’re really cooking. It’d be great if a certain actress, who must know 12 people, could endorse me.” At press time, Booker was seen trying to convince Dawson to let him use her garage for an envelope-stuffing party later that week."

Despite our arrival at this occasion of discord, please know I consider you a true compatriot: a fellow truth-seeker with no interest beyond securing what is best for our great republic.” At press time, witnesses confirmed Jordan had nearly beaten Nadler to death with a cane after being set off by a remark impugning the honor of the president."
735,"NEW YORK—Calling the running and nomination of a candidate a blatant abuse of power from the left, Fox News personality Tucker Carlson condemned the 2020 election Thursday as a partisan witch hunt orchestrated by Democrats to unseat President Trump. “This is nothing more than a Soviet-style democratic election,” said Carlson, adding that the timing of the election was especially suspicious, coming after Trump has already been in office for three years. “The millions of dollars spent on campaign ads and televised debates clearly point to some larger conspiracy being pushed by the left; it’s a total coup! This poorly executed attempt to downplay the president’s overwhelming electoral victory in 2016 with some sort of flimsy pretext to democracy is inexcusable and the exact type of threat our founding fathers warned us about. Frankly, it’s unconstitutional and shameful to see Democrats stoop to such low levels.” At press time, Democratic candidates had announced the suspension of their campaigns saying this kind of divisiveness was not what America needs right now."

He’s a really great guy who knows how to get things done in this business.

738,"SIMI VALLEY, CA—Declaring the whole visit “sort of a letdown,” Valley View Middle School student Lucas Hursch, 13, was disappointed to find Monday that the so-called Ronald Reagan Presidential Library bears no resemblance to the man who was the leader of the free world from 1980 to 1988. “You could maybe argue it has a passing resemblance from some angles, but seriously, that would be quite a stretch,” said the eighth-grader, adding that unless the 40th president had a tiny, marble version of himself inside his own body which he charged a $20 entrance fee to see, the building bearing his name shares no physical characteristics to the actor-turned-politician. “I assumed we’d get there, enter a giant glass and steel model of Reagan’s head, perhaps using The Great Communicator’s tongue as a walkway, and have the chance to explore his guts and stuff. But this place has none of that— just a boring building with completely normal doors and windows. I was taught a library is where knowledge is kept, so that kind of should be up in his brain, I guess? Also, you’d think they have it dressed up in a nice suit or something, but the outside is just bricks. If they were going for realism, they did not do a great job.” Hursch noted that the architects and building contractors had no excuse for their shoddy work, as there are thousands of photographs available to aid them in constructing a more realistic replica of the president."
739,"CONCORD, NH—Declaring that he simply has no choice in the matter, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg told reporters Friday that some political positions he holds cannot be disclosed because of a nondisclosure agreement he signed with the Pete Buttigieg presidential campaign. “I would love to answer your questions, but back in early 2019, I signed a strict, binding contract with the Pete for America organization in which I agreed not to discuss such matters,” Buttigieg said during a candidate forum, explaining that while he would love to offer more detailed and convincing proposals on issues such as healthcare, foreign policy, and immigration, he is legally prohibited from doing so. “There’s nothing I’d enjoy more than elaborating on my tax plan, for example, but I can’t talk about any views I may have held during the period of my candidacy. These are highly confidential policy initiatives. Unless the Buttigieg campaign agrees to release me from the NDA, I’m afraid there’s simply nothing I can do.” At press time, the Buttigieg campaign was reportedly scrambling to perform damage control after details of Buttigieg’s political stances had been leaked to the public."
740,"WASHINGTON—Responding to the criticism surrounding the Trump administration’s recent decision to tighten restrictions on supplemental nutrition eligibility, Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue argued Thursday that the food stamp cuts will incentivize people to go out and get exploitative jobs that won’t exist in five years. “Look, these cuts are not about kicking people off the food stamp rolls, but encouraging them to get off the couch and start looking for thankless, backbreaking work that will be rendered obsolete by either automation or outsourcing by 2025,” said Perdue, adding that the administration’s goal wasn’t to prevent Americans from affording food, but to create an empowering situation where U.S. citizens could barely have the means for sustenance because their degrading, short-term job, with severe physical and emotional hazards, forces them to work overtime without extra pay. “We are hoping the new directive will serve as a gentle nudge for Americans to take their lives into their own hands by signing up for one, two, or even three demanding jobs from a hellish megacorporation that only cares about their bottom line. People shouldn’t be relying on the government for free food, especially in this current Trump economy—there are tons of available positions that will push the boundaries of their physical and mental health, as well as significantly decrease their life expectancy, all in exchange for a meager subsistence that robs them and their families of their dignity.” Perdue also added that the new rules would work in tandem with the proposed cuts to Medicare, which the administration has argued will incentivize unemployed people to take up jobs that offer inhumane health care plans that don’t cover essential services."
741,"LONDON—Monitoring polls and news coverage of the upcoming elections, U.K. prime minister Boris Johnson reportedly expressed concern Thursday that continued accusations of anti-Semitism against the Labour Party will hurt the Tories’ hold on the bigot vote. “Those with prejudiced and discriminatory beliefs have long been a bedrock of the Conservative Party constituency, but I’m nervous that so many people attacking Labour as the party of anti-Semites will eat into our ability to win,” said Johnson, adding that he was concerned the volume of allegations that Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn wasn’t doing enough to combat anti-Semitism in his own party could result in bigoted voters believing that Labour actually represented their values. “When allegations first started coming out, I figured it would be a flash in the pan and the Tories could continue counting on the bigot vote, as we have for generations. It’s really going to hurt us if people think Labour is the party for anti-Semitism based on a few things in the media and ignore the political reality, which is that the Conservatives have for decades reliably issued policy driven by prejudice and racial animus. But it’s going to be a close election, and I’m worried if this doesn’t stop, the Tories could be at risk of losing the Islamaphobe or even the white supremacist vote, and that would be devastating at the polls.” An increasingly desperate Johnson added that he was pondering saying or doing something extremely anti-Semitic in order to remind bigoted voters on the fence about which party best advocated their interests."
742,"PLAINS, GA—As he continues to rest and recover following a brush with the ailment earlier this week, former President Jimmy Carter announced Thursday he would spend the remainder of his life educating people about the fact that men, too, routinely suffer from urinary tract infections. “This isn’t just an issue that affects women: Every urethra is delicate and susceptible, with roughly one in 10 men contracting a UTI at some point during their life,” said the 39th president of the United States, confirming he would immediately sever ties with Habitat for Humanity and terminate the Carter Center’s long-running program to eradicate Guinea worm disease in order to focus solely on the promotion of healthy male urinary tracts. “This painful affliction is often misdiagnosed, so if you feel a sharp burning sensation when urinating or notice an unfamiliar discharge in your urine, make sure you get tested. It’s nothing to be embarrassed about, and there’s no reason to live in discomfort when treatment is readily available. They give you some pills and it clears right up.” At press time, Carter was reportedly going from stall door to stall door in a public men’s room, where he urged occupants to reduce their risk of a UTI by drinking plenty of fluids and keeping the tip of their penis clean and dry."

It’s going to have a full campaign staff available around the clock, and there’s even going to be a movie theater in the headquarters where we can watch all my political ads.

Unsolicited shoulder rubs or touching a stranger’s lower back are not good, but at least they’re kind of normal.

I realize that some of the things I’ve done as mayor and said on the campaign trail aren’t going to play as well with this constituency, although, to be fair, I’ve only just realized that they’re a constituency. I honestly had no idea. But going forward, my message to black Americans is that I want your vote now that I know that you have one.” Buttigieg added that in order to avoid alienating potential supporters, he would be open to not letting black people vote."

Oh, sure, I could spare some change,” said Thompson, who, presuming the young Buttigieg canvasser speaking to him must represent a charity of some kind, fished into his pocket for the $1.17 worth of currency that would cause him to skyrocket to the top of the South Bend, IN mayor’s list of African American contributors. “I know that’s a lot of dimes, hope that’s okay.

It’s that simple.” Kahn went on to remark that if Democrats wanted these numbers to change, they would have to begin by reaching out to people and presenting them with evidence that the United States exists."
766,"WASHINGTON—After realizing there were still judicial appointments that needed to be filled during a meeting with the conservative think tank, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly pointed to a valet in the Heritage Foundation parking lot Thursday and asked him if he wanted to be a federal judge. “Hey, kid, how’d you like a lifetime appointment on the Ninth Circuit, huh?” asked McConnell, interrupting the 19-year-old temp worker’s protests that he didn’t know anything about the law to tell him that all he needed was “wipe that dumb look off your face” and he could be delivering rulings by the end of the week. “You over 18? You got an ID? That’ll do. Now just hop in this car with me and we’ll head over to the Capitol right now. Remember, abortion’s bad, corporations are good, and as for everything else, you just shut the fuck up and do as your told. Got it?” At press time, after the valet nervously informed McConnell that he was hungover and had illegal drugs in his system, the laughing Senate leader assured him that wouldn’t be an issue."
767,"WASHINGTON—Bemoaning the never-ending stream of news about the current occupant of the Oval Office, an exhausted President Donald Trump reportedly asked himself, “Oh Jesus, now what?” after turning the TV Wednesday and seeing what bullshit thing the president had done this time. “Just a single day without this garbage would be nice, but with this administration, there’s always something, isn’t there?” said Trump, who groaned that everywhere he looked—the television, the newspaper, even his Twitter feed—he was confronted with yet another fucking insane story about the president. “No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to escape that asshole. Every day I ask myself, ‘When will it all end?’ Because it’s seriously becoming more than I can handle.” At press time, Trump was overheard mumbling to himself that with his luck, he’ll probably wind up having to put up with this horseshit for another four years."
768,"WASHINGTON—Raising further questions about Donald Trump’s July call to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky, national security expert Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman testified Tuesday that the White House’s transcript of the conversation left out lengthy sections of Trump bragging about the time he was in a commercial for Pizza Hut. “When I saw there were numerous gaps in the official record of the call, I sought to add in the president’s lengthy explanation about how professional the production team had been and how some of the most classic moments in the ad were actually lines that he had improvised on set, but I was ultimately rebuffed,” said Vindman, telling House impeachment investigators that several ellipses in the call summary covered remarks about how Trump was a major force in making the stuffed-crust pizza one of America’s most popular fast food items, and that people still regularly approach him to compliment his acting skills in the ad. “I did not think it was proper for the president to ask another country’s leader to queue up a YouTube video of the advertisement so he could walk him through it moment by moment. In addition, while it is not reflected in the call summary, there was an explicit mention by Zelensky about the palpable chemistry the president had with Ivana Trump, even while they were in the midst of a divorce.” Vindman also testified that the transcript had been stored in a top-secret computer system along with records of other communications with foreign leaders, including a phone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping in which Trump spoke for over an hour about meeting Grimace during a 2002 McDonald’s commercial."
769,"DETROIT—Releasing bombshell evidence in the form of hundreds of cell phone videos taken during the gathering, numerous anonymous tipsters confirmed this week that Bernie Sanders recently attended a secret campaign meeting with 15,000 working-class donors from the Democratic Party. “This damning footage shows Sen. Sanders clandestinely mingling with thousands of representatives from the nursing, food service, and public education sectors, many of whom were apparently chauffeured to the event aboard city buses and enjoyed fountain drinks upon arriving,” said political strategist August Buckminster, adding that the event, which reportedly took place at a local vocational school, could prove problematic for the presidential candidate in his bid for the Democratic nomination. “Sanders can be heard promising a highly underprivileged audience everything from a minimum-wage increase to healthcare access to educational opportunities—whatever it takes to get them on his side. In one video, he explicitly offers a group of steel workers a quid pro quo of affordable housing in exchange for their votes. If the senator wants to win the backing of the national party, he will certainly have to answer for hobnobbing with this room full of people at the absolute lowest levels of power.” At press time, Sanders had received further criticism after documents were uncovered showing he has acted on behalf of a contingent of approximately 625,000 Vermont residents over a period of nearly 30 years."
770,"WASHINGTON—Clapping and bouncing up and down in his chair, President Donald Trump reportedly exclaimed “Again, again, again!” to aides in the Oval Office Monday after watching a video of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi’s death six times in a row. “Show me one more time! One more time, please?” said a visibly gleeful Trump, who according to sources became sullen, pounded on his desk, and threw a paperweight at acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when the adviser gently suggested it was time to move on to other items on the president’s daily agenda. “I’m not going to any stupid meetings. I want to watch my show again. I love it, I love it, I love it! Fast-forward to the part with the big boom!” At press time, reports confirmed Trump was demanding that Pentagon officials make more videos of people dying for him to watch."
771,"WASHINGTON—As a chorus of jeers began to fill Nationals Park during Game Five of the World Series, President Donald Trump was reportedly mortified Sunday after the crowd started chanting “Lock him up!” at first lady Melania Trump. “Why would they do that? It’s so mean,” said Trump, adding that when they stood up in their box seats to wave, the crowd began viciously booing Melania, an act he claimed was extremely disrespectful to the office of the first lady, especially since he was pretty sure she hadn’t done anything illegal. “Listen, there are plenty of things about Melania that I don’t like. I’ve definitely thought about replacing her. Heck, I got caught up in the chant for a little bit there too. But she should be able to attend a baseball game in peace. Someone even pulled out a sign that said ‘Impeach Trump,’ which is silly, because I don’t thinkshe can be impeached. Overall, we were incredibly embarrassed for Melania, but she was able to put on a brave face. I went over to console her and she didn’t seem bothered by it at all.” At press time, Trump kicked himself for being foolish after realizing that the crowd was probably booing Senator David Perdue (R-GA) for his unpopular agricultural policies."
772,"WASHINGTON—In an expression of pity for the man who had been slowly pacing the hallway for over an hour, House committee members taking impeachment depositions reportedly let Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) into their meeting Friday after it became clear he had come to storm the room all by himself. “We figured it wouldn’t hurt to let just one more person in, and to be honest, we all felt pretty bad for the sad sack,” said House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Eliot Engel, who added that aides had spotted the lone senator outside the Capitol’s Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility struggling to set up a Facebook livestream and checking the batteries in a bullhorn he couldn’t get to work. “You could hear him out there rehearsing his little speech to himself over and over right before he ran up and knocked on the door. When we opened it, he started sputtering and sweating and couldn’t get any words out, so after a while [Rep.] Ted [Deutch] just said, ‘Hey, Lindsey, you can come in. It’s fine.’ He sat down and mumbled something about how three or four other Republicans had told him they might be showing up later to join his protest, but no one ever did.” According to sources, Graham later announced he had more important places to be and accidentally exited through the wrong door, finding himself in a broom closet where, to avoid further embarrassment, he stayed quiet and perfectly still through the remaining six hours of the hearing."
773,"WASHINGTON—Imploring Americans to take a moment to recall jovial incidents such as tweeting “covfefe” instead of “coverage” or when he touched that strange glowing orb during a visit to Saudi Arabia, U.S. president Donald Trump, increasingly cornered by House impeachment proceedings, called upon the nation Friday to remember “all the good times.” “Come on, guys, wasn’t that fun when I got in that really huge truck or did that photo op with the taco bowl?” said the 45th commander in chief of the halcyon days when he was attacked by a bald eagle, insulted the appearance of Ted Cruz’s wife, or threw paper towels to Puerto Rico rescue workers, spiraling into an ever-deeper panic as he realized the gravity of the investigation into his diplomatic misdeeds in Ukraine. “I feel like everybody is just focusing on the negative here. Don’t forget, we’ve had a lot of great laughs together, like when that lawn mower kid came to the White House or when I looked up at a solar eclipse without the glasses. Boy, wasn’t that a real hoot? I mean, how can you not remember the fast food banquet, or when my butt looked big in that one picture? Doesn’t that count for anything? That was classic Trump.” At press time, the American public sighed deeply in fond remembrance of all the good times they’d shared together as support for impeachment dropped to 0%."
774,"WASHINGTON—Explaining there appeared to be a pattern of premeditated wrongdoing but that he didn’t want to make any claims he couldn’t substantiate with hard facts, an out-of-work Robert Mueller reportedly opened an investigation Friday into whether several neighborhood squirrels knowingly ate from his bird feeder. “On the one hand, there is just too much bird seed missing each morning to be attributable to birds alone, and on the other, there are a few suspicious squirrels who have been skulking around the yard lately—I think there’s some collusion afoot, but right now, it’s impossible to prove,” said the unshaven former FBI director, showing reporters how he had propped up several camcorders on his windowsill to film the squirrels when he wasn’t watching the animals through binoculars from under a canoe he’d flipped over in the corner of his yard. “I thought I had them the other night when the automatic light went on beside the garage, but by the time I got down there, the birdseed was gone. I followed the trail for a while, but it was raining and I lost the scent. There was a late-night meeting a few days ago between a possum and a raccoon I think might be germane to the case, but I don’t want to leap to any conclusions. I haven’t seen the raccoon interact with the squirrels yet, which makes me think there’s some go-between critter I haven’t identified. It’s a big question mark on the board I’ve got inside. They’re wily—they’re trying to play 12-step chess. Fortunately, though, I’ve got some experience playing that game. And I’ve got all the time in the world ever since I cleared up that inquiry into why the begonias kept getting trampled and also since my wife left me.” At press time, a frantic, wild-eyed Mueller had burst into FBI headquarters and demanded someone help him file a subpoena to get access to the inside of a tree where he suspected the squirrels were storing the stolen birdseed."
775,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to evade the escalating Ukraine scandal, President Donald Trump reportedly tied thousands of balloons to the roof of the White House Thursday in order to sail far away from the impeachment inquiry. “The U.S. has turned against me, so it’s time for me to float off to some distant land,” said the president, crouching next to a balustrade on the White House roof and blowing air into balloon after balloon. “All right, Mick [Mulvaney], time for you to jump out the window to lighten the load. Just a few thousand more and I’ll be aloft. If the wind holds, I should make it to Saudi Arabia by morning. Farewell! On to my next great adventure!” At press time, dozens of House GOP members were holding a press conference outside the White House to describe how beautiful and majestic the president looked flying through the air."
776,"WASHINGTON—Staging the protest in response to what they called “a lack of transparency,” House Republicans stormed the National Statuary Hall Thursday, demanding to be allowed inside Elijah Cummings’ casket. “As voting members of Congress, we have an obligation to our constituents to get inside and find out what’s in there—it could be anything,” said Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who explained how a closed-casket viewing went against the very foundations of American democracy while House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and Steve King (R-IA) furiously pounded their fists against the coffin. “Right now, it’s an all-Democratic casket. Not even the press are allowed inside. We’ve been knocking all morning and have yet to receive a response, those cowards!” At press time, freaked-out House Republicans were calling for a counter investigation after discovering a body inside the casket."
777,"WASHINGTON—Shutting down a regular monthly delivery that had been in place since the Truman administration, President Donald Trump canceled the White House’s subscription toHighlightsmagazine Tuesday over what he deemed to be rampant anti-Goofus bias. “Everyone’s getting on his case all the time—Goofus has been treated very, very unfairly,” said Trump, decrying the 60-year-old children’s magazine’s obvious pro-Gallant agenda while praising Goofus as a bright kid smart enough to look out for number one and who knew how to cut a deal. “‘Gross Gallant’ is no angel either! I hear he’s in bed with some pretty shady figures, I won’t say who. Too bad forHighlights, a once-great publication that has gone downhill in recent years. Unfair that they never publish your drawings when you submit them. Also, I looked at that scene of the kids playing, and the second picture? No differences! None at all! And I was in that terrible maze for hours. Not good. There was clearly no exit.” At press time, Trump had reversed his position and instructed an aide to renew the White House’s subscription after discoveringHighlightsgave him some positive press by mentioning him in a list of U.S. presidents."
778,"PLAINS, GA—Responding with deadly force to a threat that left the 39th president of the United States in the hospital, Secret Service agents confirmed they opened fire Monday evening on an expanse of slippery flooring that had made an attempt on the life of Jimmy Carter in his own home. “It’s unclear how a hostile patch of slick tile managed to get so close to President Carter, but upon identifying the wet spot that caused him to fall, we immediately began shooting,” said agent Joseph Pena, who according to federal officials put his own safety on the line, heroically throwing himself atop what appeared to be a juice spill to prevent it from doing any more harm to the 95-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner. “In the heat of the altercation, there were unfortunately some casualties, with an innocent table lamp lost after taking friendly fire. We are proud to report, however, that the tile that wounded President Carter has been permanently neutralized and no longer poses any danger.” In response to the incident, the Secret Service has reportedly added personnel to Carter’s security detail, assigning separate agents to individually patrol every surface of the former president’s home."
779,"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging the hurt he had caused, President Donald Trump apologized Tuesday for describing the House impeachment inquiry as a “lynching,” saying he had been unaware of the term’s association with the 1918 murder of Robert Prager, a German American immigrant killed by an angry mob. “I realize now my remark was insensitive, and insulting to the memory of Mr. Prager and those impacted by his tragic death,” said the president, who asked the American people to forgive him, emphasizing how disturbed he had been when a member of his staff told him how Prager had been singled out and killed by coal miners in Illinois during a wartime wave of anti-German sentiment. “Upon learning of this foul act, I have come to understand that lynching represents a deeply troubling chapter in our nation’s past. Going forward, we must make a greater effort to reckon with this difficult part of our history, by which I mean specifically the terrible fate that befell an innocent German man on April 5, 1918. I am truly sorry for any pain my statement may have caused the German American community.” At press time, sources confirmed Trump’s base appeared satisfied with his apology and had no objections to a new tweet in which he compared the impeachment inquiry to “the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.”"
780,"DAMASCUS, SYRIA—Hanging up after yet another 30-minute rant about the Democratic National Committee, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reported Monday that every time White House hopeful Tulsi Gabbard calls him to vent about campaign politics, he feels she’s taking advantage of his friendship. “I like Tulsi, but when we talk, everything’s all about her, as if she’s the only person in the world with problems,” said Assad, adding that it would be nice if once in a while Rep. Gabbard asked how his family or his 8-year-old civil war was going instead of whining about how she continues to trail Sen. Kamala Harris in New Hampshire. “Now there’s this whole thing with Hillary Clinton, and believe me, I’ve had my own problems with Hillary, but you don’t hear me droning on and on about her all the time. At least when [Russian President Vladimir] Putin or [Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali] Khamenei call, they ask me how I’ve been. Tulsi, meanwhile, begins every other sentence with ‘When I’m president,’ and I don’t know how to tell her that’s just not something that’s going to happen for her.” At press time, sources confirmed Assad had put Gabbard on speaker so he could sign off on a few sarin gas attacks while occasionally punctuating the conversation with “Totally” or “Wow, that’s crazy.”"
781,"WASHINGTON—Erupting in praise after the House Speaker set the image as her Twitter account’s header photo, resistance Democrats cheered Nancy Pelosi online Thursday after a viral moment emerged of her sitting quietly and deferring to a roomful of corporate lobbyists. “You get that bread, bitch!” said Twitter user elaine4progress, one of thousands of anti-Trump accounts that immediately responded with an outpouring of retweets and “Make it rain!” comments to applaud the House Speaker’s commitment to reassuring business leaders from Goldman Sachs and Berkshire Group that their concerns were being heard. “Hell yes, succumb to corporate pressure, queen! The Democratic war chest is bae.” At press time, the hashtags #GirlBoss and #FillThoseCoffers were trending on social media after Pelosi uploaded a photo of the $10,000 check she had received from corporate bundlers."
782,"NEW YORK—Leaping from a bannister on the upper story of a Manhattan luxury hotel, the president’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani reportedly shouted “you’ll never take me alive!” Wednesday before jumping towards a chandelier and immediately falling three stories onto the floor below. “Good luck catching me as I disappear like a ghost in the wind—ha, ha, you can’t catch someone who never existed! Sayonara, suckers,” said the former New York City mayor, who, moments before, had scrambled up the hotel’s guardrail after watching a CNN report implicating him in the Trump Ukraine scandal, his fingers grazing the very bottom of the ornate light fixture as he plummeted downward, smashing into the marble floor with a dull, wet thud. “Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck. Oh god, my fucking back. It hurts so bad. Ah, Jesus Christ.” At press time, the hotel’s guests were politely sidestepping a bleeding and toothless Giuliani as he painfully crawled under a grand piano to hide from the authorities."
783,"LANCASTER, OH—Admitting that he had been struggling to identify which candidate he preferred, local Trump supporter James Brimhall told reporters Wednesday that he came away from the Democratic debates with a more clear idea of who he wanted to kill. “Early on, I thought it was definitely going to be Biden, but a lot of other candidates made great points about why they needed to be killed to save America, so I was really torn,” said Brimhall, who claimed hearing Bernie Sanders’ arguments for universal healthcare put him at the top of his list for a few months. “I was actually flirting with Andrew Yang for a bit—his freedom dividend seems like exactly the kind of idea I need to cleanse from the face of the Earth, but there wasn’t much beyond that. I’m honestly leaning towards Warren now. She has a lot of proposals, and her fire during the debate really stood out as something I would want to destroy. Plus, I like that she’s a woman.” Brimhall added that we would probably hold off making his final decision until after President Trump singles one out as an enemy of America."

785,"WESTERVILLE, OH—Revealing that his heart attack left him worried that he’s spent too much time obsessed with things that do not matter, Bernie Sanders renounced his past call for economic equality during Tuesday night’s debate after his brush with death taught him that money is not everything. “I’ve spent 50 years worrying about money, but now I realize that fair wages and housing are not really important—it’s people and relationships, it’s living in this moment right now,” said Sanders, who admitted that recovering from his surgery provided an opportunity to think about how true wealth and power does not come from money; it comes from having a devoted family. “I encourage my supporters to forget about all that nonsense about income inequality. I was all ‘jobs, jobs, jobs.’ Why was I so obsessed with work and material wellbeing? I wanted a wealth tax, but you can’t put a dollar value on a sunset. Money for college won’t buy you a baby’s smile. I’ve wasted my life fighting for a massive transfer of wealth, so now I’m fighting for a massive transfer of love.” At press time, Sanders had walked over to hug a stunned Beto O’Rourke and told him he loves him."

Sir! Let me just ask the former vice president one last thing about his son’s dealings with Burisma. I’ve earned my place at this desk tonight, and I can’t help but wonder why Don Lemon is getting the lion’s share of the time to address the candidates. Why not allow the American people to decide which of our moderation styles they prefer?” At press time, all 16 moderators had shifted into their closing question and were speaking in unison to ask exactly how the candidates would pay for their ambitious proposals without raising taxes on the middle class."

It’s a few weeks before Halloween and no one even thought to dress up as the Wolfman or something? It’s not like I was taking this costume seriously, but Jesus Christ, I just thought it’d be a nice way for everyone to lighten the mood. Shit. I must look like a complete idiot up here.” At press time, Buttigieg had begun responding to moderator Erin Burnett’s question about his campaign platform by stressing that America only needed to “find their heart” before cutting himself off in annoyance and telling her to just forget the whole goddamn thing."
789,"WESTERVILLE, OH—In a television interview where he conceded that he had made some significant mistakes, Hunter Biden admitted Tuesday it was poor judgment on his part to be involved with the corrupt Biden family. “Now that I’ve had time to step back and take stock, it’s clear to me that due to the numerous improprieties swirling around them, I never should have gotten involved with the Biden family in the first place,” said Hunter, 49, adding that although he believed his conduct and that of the Bidens fell short of anything illegal, members of the family were clearly involved in shady financial dealings and questionable foreign entanglements, and he should have steered clear altogether. “When I received a position in the Biden family, I was obviously afforded a great deal of power and opportunity, and all that opulence got the better of me. When you’re in that deep, sometimes you don’t see how bad things really are. I understand that I’m under more scrutiny that most people, and to be publicly involved with the Biden family gives the appearance that I’ve done things the American people wouldn’t approve of.

We generate our own electricity, and my aides set up this whole system for collecting and purifying water. Out here, if the feds try to trample my freedoms, they’re more likely to tread on one of our tripwire explosives or spring-loaded bear traps.” Later, as he patted a 12-gauge pump-action shotgun, the 45th president of the United States was overheard saying that anyone who trespassed on his property to enforce a subpoena would “have to get past this baby first.”"

Devin Nunes (R-CA) reportedly took a moment Wednesday to reflect that at least the Twitter users he was suing for mocking him didn’t know about his leaking, prolapsed anus. “These people were really mean to me when they were just critiquing my public statements and voting record, so I can just imagine the sort of field day they’d be having if they found out that my rectum is telescoped out past my anus, resulting in a constant flow of fecal matter dribbling down my leg at all times,” thought the congressman, acknowledging that if social media users discovered that he had previously worn a diaper but had stopped because it only ended up overflowing in a matter of hours, he’d likely never hear the end of it. “To be honest, I’m also pretty fortunate that no one has sussed out the fact that the only way for me to achieve sexual satisfaction is to ejaculate into a bowl of clam chowder and feed it to an unwitting victim while filming the whole thing. That would be mighty embarrassing, to say nothing of me owning the country’s largest collection of frozen condoms full of shit. And the worst part is, I’d have no legal standing to sue if any of this came out since all of this is 100% the God’s honest truth.” At press time, Nunes had decided to cheer himself up about his tapeworm-infested scrotum by buying himself a new child bride."

Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), who along with every Republican in both the House and Senate stated that while killing off their families in cold blood might not be entirely proper, it was certainly not an impeachable offense, no matter how the media tried to spin it. “Now, this is not an action I would have taken myself. I personally would not have wrapped my hands around my 5-year-old son’s neck and crushed his windpipe. But if Donald Trump’s approach to governing is sometimes a bit outside the ordinary, that’s because Donald Trump is no ordinary president. And maybe that’s not such a bad thing.” Later, with his beloved sister’s face turning purple as the commander-in-chief asphyxiated her with a length of barbed wire, Sen.

Christ, why do you think Bolton’s gone?” Several White House officials went on to cast doubt about whether Trump had truly given Velazquez the Presidential Medal of Honor or if she simply found it while tidying up the Oval Office."
796,"WASHINGTON—Scanning for discounts in the precision weapon and early warning satellite sections, a visibly distressed President Trump reportedly flipped through the Raytheon catalog in a panic Friday after realizing he had accidentally promised China and Ukraine the same FGM-148 Javelin missile. “Shit, shit, shit—when I offered that rocket launcher to Xi [Jinping] I totally forgot I’d already told [Volodymyr] Zelensky he could have it,” said Trump, who was overheard muttering to himself that he could just tell the Chinese president the Javelins were out of stock, but then Xi would be upset once he found out the Ukrainians had managed to get one. “Maybe I’ll get China a Patriot, instead? No, that’s too much. I don’t want to seem desperate. And the Sparrow is so passé at this point, they wouldn’t even want that. Damn it, I need to get something for Australia, too, don’t I?” At press time, sources confirmed Trump had given up and decided to send all the countries willing to assist in his reelection campaign a $400 million Raytheon gift card so they could just pick out what they wanted."
797,"NEW YORK—Faced with criticism over his role in pushing Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 campaign on behalf of President Trump, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani said Friday that whenever the pressure gets to him, he seeks solace in his fond recollections of the events of Sept. 11, 2001. “Most of the time I have a pretty thick skin, but if I do start getting down on myself, I just let my thoughts go back to that fateful morning and how it forever changed my life for the better,” Giuliani told reporters as he looked wistfully out his office window and recalled his “heyday,” when he spent months basking in the praise of a nation and carefully leveraged his newfound influence to make himself a multimillionaire. “That’s where I find my strength. Anytime I need a little pick-me-up, all I need to do is look at a picture of Ground Zero and I’m right as rain. Do I wish I could go back and relive that day? Of course. But we can’t go back, can we?” Giuliani then reportedly set aside the congressional subpoena he had been reading through and spent the next several hours rewatching CNN’s live coverage of the second plane slamming into the World Trade Center."
798,"WASHINGTON—Calling the procedure an “absolute necessity” to save her campaign, sources confirmed Thursday that Kamala Harris was rushed into emergency heart surgery immediately after seeing the positive reception Bernie Sanders received. “After seeing a sudden surge in thoughts, prayers, and monetary donations received by the Sanders 2020 campaign, Mrs. Harris was rushed into the operating room where doctors promptly inserted stents into several of her arteries,” said campaign manager Juan Rodriguez, adding that although she’d only been awake for a few hours, the surgery had already allowed the Democratic candidate to gain four points in the polls and grace the front page of every major national newspaper. “While the procedure was admittedly a shock to many, Mrs. Harris’s family and friends have thankfully reported that she’s already feeling 10 times more presidential. And to anyone who doubts her fitness for office, remember: Unlike Bernie, Kamala’s heart was never blocked in the first place.” At press time, Harris had reportedly surpassed Sanders, Warren, and Biden in popularity after contracting a deadly form of MRSA during her recovery."
799,"WASHINGTON—Lighting candles at the altar before lowering his head in reverence, President Donald Trump prayed for the lord to guide him in his darkest hour Thursday while kneeling before a portrait of himself. “You, the all-seeing, all-knowing, he who stands above all other beings, in my time of need, please show me the way,” said Trump, gazing into the eyes of his portrait and asking for the kind of strength that can only be granted by the almighty himself. “Eternal one, king of kings, I have always served you dutifully and have never forsaken the quest for your glory. In all your omnipotence, I beg that you shine a light and show me how to strike down your enemies. If delivered from this trial, I will spread your word to the ends of the Earth and make sure all of humanity sings your praises.” Trump concluded the prayer by saying he would gladly offer up his children in holy sacrifice for his lord if it would secure his glory."
800,"EDMONTON, CANADA—Responding to criticism of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline during a visit to Alberta, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Thursday that pumping nearly a million barrels of oil a day through indigenous lands would be a ritual of deep spiritual significance to his people. “These pipes are a sacred tradition handed down by my ancestors, a reminder of our connection to the land and the riches it can provide,” said Trudeau, who described his participation in age-old rites in which his family and friends would prostrate themselves before pipelines, praying for the safe passage of the petroleum within. “Just as the smokestack rises from the ground, so too must the pipe go beneath the earth. The Creator has imbued the sands of this province with great bounty, and with the proper offerings of oil company subsidies and construction grants, we may be so blessed as to profit from its gifts.” At press time, Trudeau had concluded his remarks by inviting members of the press to join him in a traditional pipeline-blessing ceremony, beginning with the ritual application of refined black oil all over one’s face and body."
801,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that his presence on a phone call where President Donald Trump reportedly asked the president of Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden was completely above board, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo clarified Wednesday that anyone in the country can listen in on Trump administration phone calls by picking up their phones and dialing 9. “I’m not sure why the left-wing media and Democrats are so obsessed with the fact that I was on the Ukraine call when anyone in America can join simply by dialing 9—just remember to hit the pound key afterward and it should take you right in,” said Pompeo, further clarifying that while service was a little bit spotty in Alaska and some remote areas in the western states, any U.S. resident with a phone could otherwise access every Trump administration call at any time. “Whenever you want to listen to what Trump’s up to, just hit the 9 key. If the line fills up after the first million people, just press 8 and it’ll take you to a different teleconferencing room. I thought everyone knew about the free administration phone line. We just ask that you stay on mute unless you have something meaningful to add, since it can get kind of chaotic in there. Heck, I was listening in on Trump’s calls with foreign leaders from day one of his administration, way before I was secretary of state. You can learn all kinds of things. And don’t worry, you can listen in from outside the country too—you just need your three-digit country code, although data rates may apply.” At press time, Pompeo was kicking back after dialing 9 and being immediately added to a call in which Trump was trying to convince French president Emmanuel Macron to back a potential military action against Iran."
802,"WASHINGTON—Strapping the suspect to a chair and demanding to know if “he was the whistleblower, or else,” the Trump boys reportedly spent hours interrogating a White House janitor Wednesday after giving him a serum of all the sodas mixed together. “Well, well, well, Mr. Janitor, good luck keeping secrets from our awesome dad now that you’ve taken a sip of our super-powerful CIA brain juice,” said Eric Trump, prompting Don Jr. to give the White House employee some more of the “truth sermon [sic],” which included a mixture of Diet Coke, Fanta, Sprite, Powerade, Minute Maid, and Mr. Pibb, after the custodian refused to talk. “Who was it, toilet man? Was it one of our daddy’s friends? Or was it a pretty spy lady? Or was it you the whole time who whistleblew [sic] our dad all over the TV just for being the bestest president in the whole wide world?” At press time, Eric had reportedly begun to hyperventilate after accidentally taking a sip of the 30-ounce soda cup, letting out a huge burp, and realizing that he might have been the whistleblower the whole time."
803,"LAS VEGAS—Championing his new policy proposal as a way to reduce the gap between the working class and the 1%, Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders unveiled a comprehensive plan Tuesday to tackle income inequality with an art heist from a billionaire’s home. “We should not be living in a country where all the wealth is concentrated in a few very rich people, which is why my new plan to remove artworks from an ultrawealthy estate in the dead of night and sell them through third parties will redistribute hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Pollocks, de Koonings, and Rothkos to the hardworking American people,” said Sanders of the detailed 85-page plan outlining his system to lift expensive paintings, sculptures, jewels, and other artworks from billionaires’ private collections in their homes in the Hamptons, Upper East Side, and Palo Alto. “Million-dollar impressionist paintings and modernist sculptures should be a public good, not kept locked up in some CEO’s mansion. Using a progressive seizure rate that takes the most art from the wealthiest individuals, my plan will go a long way toward shrinking the gap between the haves and have-nots in this country. It describes in great detail how I will put the suction cups on my hands and climb to the window, then use one of those circular cutters to remove a pane of glass from the ceiling in order to place my grappling hook to rappel down. My plan also calls for building a diverse working-class coalition of Americans to put on cable-repairman clothes, gain entry to the house, disable the alarm system to access complicated private safes in under 30 seconds, and then wait outside in a requisitioned UPS delivery truck for a quick escape. Under my proposal, we’ll be able to offload the stolen Monets, Picassos, and Warhols to pay for free college for all Americans.” At press time, the media was criticizing Sanders’ proposal by questioning how the candidate intended to pay for all the black ski masks, razor blades for cutting paintings out of their frames, and getaway vans described in his plan."
804,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that they faced a serious roadblock in their effort to unmask the source of a leaked complaint about the president’s conversations with Ukraine, aides to Donald Trump investigating a whistleblower reported to be a CIA agent were struggling Monday to identify a single person in the agency with moral principles. “After we learned that the whistleblower is CIA, we figured it would be pretty quick to narrow down his identity among the few people there with a moral compass, but the more we looked into it, we realized we can’t think of anybody who has one,” said Stephen Miller, adding that aides had cleared everyone with links to the intelligence community they knew had knowledge of Trump’s Ukraine conversations due to the fact that they were all too unethical and black-hearted to care about any presidential misconduct. “Naturally, we started at the top, but obviously [CIA director Gina] Haspel is cleared because of the whole torture thing, and all the other leading officials are into really shady shit too. Pretty much anyone who’s been there longer than a year or two is out, and honestly, you don’t even expect people who have any deeply held sense of right and wrong to make it past the application process. There was one guy we were pretty sure was the whistleblower, but then we looked into him and saw that he was involved in the [2009] Honduras coup. You think a guy with no scruples like that is really going to stick his neck on the line for the nation? It’s hard, since this whole situation is completely antithetical to everything the CIA stands for.” Several Trump aides confirmed they were hoping to enter the whistleblower’s mindset by developing any shred of moral principle themselves."
805,"FORT WORTH, TX—Following a CIA officer’s much-applauded decision to disclose evidence that President Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to interfere in the 2020 election, former intelligence analysts Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner expressed confidence Thursday that the nation’s newfound appreciation for whistleblowers would get them out of jail. “Now that everyone really seems to like it when wrongdoing is exposed, I’m sure it’s just a matter of time before they clear my name and let me go,” Winner said by phone from a federal prison in Texas, echoing the sentiments of Manning, who told reporters she expected not only to be released from jail but also to be allowed to return immediately to active duty in the Army. “Americans recognize that what this anonymous whistleblower did was both courageous and patriotic, so I’m sure to be commended for releasing a report on interference in the 2016 election, right? I was ahead of my time, really. I’m not saying there will be a parade in my honor, but I sure wouldn’t be surprised. I’ll be out of here in a day or two, and then, who knows? Maybe I’ll even run for public office.” At press time, sources confirmed a chipper Edward Snowden had informed officials in the Justice Department that he was finally ready to leave Moscow and fly back home."
806,"NOVATO, CA—While following coverage of an unnamed government employee bringing forth a complaint that President Donald Trump had asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the son of presidential candidate Joe Biden, Resistance Democrat Kathy Gillford was reportedly racking her brain Thursday to sexualize the anonymous whistleblower. “He’s being so brave standing up for his country and resisting President Cheeto, it just makes me so excited, but I’m having some trouble deciding exactly how I want to picture him—do I want the whistleblower to be a suave James Bond type in a suit, or more of a ripped, muscular superhero?” said Gillford, 49, who added that she was hoping to visualize a fantasy version of the whistleblower that could bring her to a shuddering climax matching the intensity that the thought of a shirtless, oiled-up Robert Mueller did during his special investigation. “I just want to masturbate to the justice of it, but the image in my mind is lacking a certain specificity right now. It was so easy when I was thinking about how alluring it was watching Preet Bharara stand up to the president, and I still remember how hard I came when I pictured that rugged silver fox James Mattis tell he-who-shall-not-be-named that he was putting country over party. I’ll think of something, though, even if it’s just imagining the whistleblower with a six-pack and flowing hair riding a horse like I did with Adam Schiff. Put it this way—I’d let him in on my state secrets.” At press time, 2,849 other users had commented on her Facebook post about the whistleblower describing the ways they had sexualized the anonymous official and what they wanted him to do to them."
807,"WASHINGTON—Seeking to exculpate the president from alleged wrongdoing, the White House released a lightly edited memorandum of the U.S. Constitution Wednesday that specifically declares Trump’s innocence. “[The President of the United States of America] shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, can talk to whatever foreign official he wants about any subject whenever he wants, consequence-free,” read the memo, which White House sources indicated did not include the full text of the nation’s founding document but offered a summation of its important points such as “Congress has the power to shut up and stay out of the President’s way.” “The President, Vice President, and all Civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors, assuming they are Democratic officials. This impeachment process shall not hold in the event that the president is a former real estate developer whose party controls the Senate...Make America Great Again! Trump 2020!” At press time, legal scholars had suggested that despite the edits, the memorandum contained over a dozen examples of the president breaking the law."
808,"WASHINGTON—Collapsing from the extreme exertion required to announce an impeachment inquiry into the president, a weak and exhausted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was reportedly given a saline drip Tuesday night following an hours-long stretch during which she stood firm in her convictions. “She’s obviously not used to following her conscience like this, or acting in accordance with any clear set of principles, so the experience has left her completely drained,” said Pelosi’s communication director, Ashley Etienne, confirming that medical personnel administered fluids to the speaker after she went an entire news cycle without ever capitulating, an amount of strain that can be life-threatening for a 17-term lawmaker. “Once her voice started to quiver and she slumped down at the end of her speech, we realized her body simply couldn’t take this level of sustained effort. We’re honestly just amazed she lasted as long as she did.” At press time, sources reported House Democratic leaders had postponed the impeachment investigation once more after a doctor prescribed six months of bed rest for Pelosi."
809,"EL PASO, TX—Worrying over whether he had ever engaged in any activity that might hurt his father’s candidacy, Henry O’Rourke, the 8-year-old son of White House hopeful Beto O’Rourke, expressed concern Tuesday that President Trump might instruct Ukraine to investigate him next. “What if those Ukrainian guys find out about that time last year I got my recess privileges taken away for acting up in class?” the visibly panicked third-grader said as he repeatedly searched beneath his bed and inside his closet to make sure there weren’t any unfinished school assignments or other incriminating materials that could be used against him or his father. “I don’t think I’ve done anything too bad, but I’d better cover my tracks just in case. Oh God—there is that time I copied my friend Tyler’s math homework! It only happened once, though, and I don’t think he’ll talk. Still, they went after Hunter [Biden], and it’s only a matter of time before they start digging up dirt on me.” The young O’Rourke added that he was glad his father never gained enough influence in Congress for anyone to ever accuse him of abusing his power for his son’s benefit."
810,"WASHINGTON—Describing his behavior as deeply inappropriate, Democratic leaders roundly criticized President Donald Trump Tuesday for attacking climate activist Greta Thunberg instead of just offering her praise and then subsequently ignoring her. “Yet again, we have seen the cruel and vindictive nature of a president who thinks it’s acceptable to hurl schoolyard taunts at this wonderful young woman instead of acting very interested in what she has to say and then doing nothing whatsoever about it,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, adding that this incident raised questions about the fundamental decency of someone who would mock a 12-year-old activist when he should be gleaning whatever social capital he can from her and then pretending as though she never existed. “I want to say right now to Ms. Thunberg that Donald Trump’s dismissive comments do not represent the country as a whole. I assure you that the next time you want to speak to leaders who could benefit from being associated with climate activism, the Democratic party is here for you as long as the cameras are rolling and not a second longer.” Hoyer went on to condemn Fox News for launching ad hominem attacks against Thunberg instead of merely criticizing her proposals as unrealistic and anti-business."
811,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to hold those responsible to full account, congressional Democrats issued a resolution Monday condemning Ukraine for its role in making it harder to avoid impeaching President Trump. “It’s completely unacceptable for Ukraine’s leaders to engage in these potentially criminal talks that have pushed us perilously close to taking action against the president,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, telling reporters that the bill, H.R. 2995, would “send a powerful message” to any nation or individual who would attempt to force Democrats’ hands at conducting oversight. “If these allegations are true that Ukraine allowed itself to be blackmailed by President Trump, we have no choice but to denounce these actions in the strongest possible terms. It’s deeply reckless for Ukraine to push us towards investigating criminal behavior, especially so close to an election year, and we hope this resolution will put an end to that.” At press time, Pelosi had expressed her satisfaction that the bill had been approved after receiving widespread Republican support."
812,"BOSTON—Moments after announcing plans to mount a 2020 challenge to Ed Markey for his Massachusetts Senate seat, Representative Joe Kennedy III was forced Saturday to dodge crashing planes, swerving cars, and a tumbling stampede of rolling concrete tubes all seemingly charging in his direction. “I believe this state is ready for a bold change in direction, and I intend to take us there next year—oh, dear God!” said Kennedy, who covered his head to shield himself from debris as a tractor trailer smashed wildly through the wall behind him, then sprinted into the street past several exploding manhole covers, eluding a dozen lightning strikes, ducking just under the swinging attacks of several sword-wielding assassins, hiding in an alleyway from a sniper’s laser sights, and finally jumping clear of a sinkhole that swallowed several blocks of East Boston. “Help! Help! Can anyone hear me? Jesus Christ, how are there two tidal waves in the middle of the city?” At press time, Kennedy was spotted waving to paparazzi while boarding a rickety vintage light plane and setting off towards a campaign appearance directly into a raging thunderstorm."
813,"OTTAWA—Following the release of images that reveal the head of government wore blackface and brownface on multiple occasions, Canadian head of government Justin Trudeau responded to criticism Thursday with a new campaign ad in which the slogan “Triggered?” appears on screen as he dabs his face with burnt cork. “Oh, boo-hoo, I’m sorry, do my policies bother you, SJWs?” Trudeau said in the 30-second TV spot, during which he vows not to be victimized by cancel culture and remarks that if this was how “those prissy, whiny snowflakes” were going to be, he didn’t even want to be their “goddamn prime minister.” “Wake up, soyboys! From Vancouver to Halifax, it’s time for this country to stop answering to the feminazis and uncuck itself. The so-called ‘tolerant’ left is just going to have to deal with the fact that by the time I’m through, there’s not going to be a single safe space left in all of Canada.” Within hours of the new slogan’s release, polls confirmed the prime minister’s approval rating had skyrocketed to 91%."
814,"WASHINGTON—Explaining how human error or inaccuracy of the weaponry should eventually produce the desired result, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly ordered the military Thursday to increase bombing in Afghanistan after figuring that they’ll miss and hit Iran at some point. “I am ordering a sustained bombing offensive in Afghanistan since there’s a really good chance that if we launch enough missiles, one of them has to veer off course and eventually strike Iran,” said Pompeo, adding that they are going to make sure to put their most inept military commanders in charge of the air attacks and just wait until one ballistic missile deviates and destroys a residential neighborhood in the Islamic Republic. “Instead of directly engaging with Iran, we’re just going to send a bunch more drones to Afghanistan and let our incompetence play itself out. Given our track record, it really shouldn’t take too long.” At press time, Pompeo decided that the U.S. military might as well ratchet up bombing in Syria and Yemen to make it happen faster."
815,"WASHINGTON—Addressing the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia that took out more than half that nation’s oil production capacity, President Trump told reporters Tuesday the precision-targeted bombings were a major act of aggression by Iran or some country like that. “The primary actor behind the strike on our Saudi allies was definitely Iran or one of those countries in that same part of the world—someplace with a lot of deserts, a lot of Muslims, a lot of guys with beards,” Trump said to members of the White House press corps, adding, “Syria maybe? Jordan?” before his voice dropped off to an inaudible mumble. “The American people can trust we will take swift action against...Qatar? No, that’s not it. We’re pretty sure Saudi Arabia didn’t do it, because why would they? Why would you bomb your own oil refineries? Then again, you never know. You never can tell. What do you guys think?” The president later clarified that the United States would bomb whichever country the Saudis paid it to bomb."
816,"BETHESDA, MD—Following the former Trump administration national security advisor receiving several warnings to tone down the use of violent rhetoric against other residents, John Bolton was reportedly asked Monday to leave a condo board meeting after repeatedly advocating bombing the Isaacsons. “Mr. Bolton, we must ask that you remove yourself until you can have a calm, rational discussion about the Isaacson family’s noise or over-use of common spaces without recommending double-tapping their unit with an MQ-9 Reaper drone,” said condo board president Marcia Lewis, adding that while she understood Bolton had recently lost his job and was spending more time at his residence, there was a formal process for lodging a complaint that didn’t include any options for the use of military force against the Isaacsons, nor for selling drones to a neighboring condo association that could act as a proxy. “We’ve done some research into your proposal, and we concluded that it would almost certainly kill the Isaacson family, including their three children, as well as cause mass casualties among the Portico’s other residents, which strikes us as a profound overreaction to Billy Isaacson hitting your car’s side mirror with his basketball the other day. And while we will look into your claim that the family is harboring pets, we have to remind you that owning a dog is not an act of aggression, Mr. Bolton. Furthermore, we have to ask you to tone down your attacks on the Sawyers, as hosting guests late, while annoying, is not a grave threat to national security. In the future, we really suggest you try sitting down with these families for a cup of coffee rather than continuing to call for an all-out aerial assault.” At press time, the condo board had issued Bolton a warning after learning that he had contacted a local demolition company in an effort to get them to knock down the condo building."

818,"HOUSTON—Saying it was time someone finally took a stand for struggling, Spanish-language networks, moderator Jorge Ramos paused the democratic debate Thursday to ask candidates how they would help media companies with $7.5 billion of debt. “No one—not one of you—has told the American people how you would save hardworking broadcast networks who sold themselves out to private equity firms, and also happen to be Hispanic and based in Miami,” said Ramos, who then looked each candidate in the eye and specified that their solutions need to keep in mind that the company in question has no long-term strategy and only ever knew how to make money from streaming soccer games and telenovelas. “Senator Sanders, would you say these companies would benefit from more needless layoffs? Or, Senator Warren, maybe they should just blindly start investing in companies they didn’t know what to do with again? Also, if you feel there is no solution, please be clear about it.” At press time, every single Democratic candidate had answered that the only solution was to shut the company down and finally put it out of its misery."
819,"HOUSTON—Startling the 10 candidates who qualified to participate in the event, Marianne Williamson materialized on the debate stage in a puff of purple smoke Thursday, proclaiming the Democratic National Committee’s polling requirements were no match for the power of positive thinking. “The DNC thinks I need to get at least 2% in four qualifying polls, but they think so small,” said the author and presidential hopeful, who announced that by unlocking a deep and powerful mental space at the core of her being, she could participate in the debate at Texas Southern University despite having failed to meet the “narrow-minded” threshold set by party leaders. “By avoiding all negative thoughts and putting mind over matter, I have been able to transcend mere material concerns such as poll numbers. While I don’t have the necessary support of voters, I do have something far more valuable: a profound belief in the oneness of all living things.” At press time, sources confirmed a podium of pure light had sprung up before Williamson as she began to answer a question from George Stephanopoulos about how she would respond as president to an economy on the brink of recession."
820,"WASHINGTON—Seeking to mollify a segment of their base clamoring for inquiries into the president’s misconduct, House Democrats announced Tuesday that they would be holding the administration accountable by voting on an agricultural bill in which the first letter of every line spells out “Impeach Trump.” “We believe this is a fair compromise that falls short of the full impeachment inquiry some have asked for, but still shows voters who have the correct decoder that Democrats aren’t taking this president’s crimes lying down,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, telling reporters that the bill had been brought to the floor despite objections from Democrats in battleground districts who generally favored a more complex alphabetic cipher that would eventually spell out “Impeach Trump if polling improves,” or, “Impeach Trump at the ballot box.” “When our children look back on this period of history, they will know that the Democratic party served as a check on this corrupt administration by putting forward a bold and straightforward word puzzle proclaiming that this is not who we are as Americans.” At press time, an elated Hoyer confirmed that the House had secured the bill’s passage after tacking on an additional $2.5 million in funding for the president’s border wall."
821,"SANTA FE, NM—Announcing her intent to run as a Democrat for New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, former CIA agent and author Valerie Plame released a campaign video Monday in which she is shown using the skills she learned as a spy to torture voters. “Hi, my name is Valerie Plame, and I want to put my specialized CIA training to work for the American people,” said Plame in the video, which shows her smiling with a diverse group of potential voters before zip-tying their wrists, covering their heads with bags, and locking them in the trunk of a black Chevy Camaro. “Whether I’m fighting to secure infrastructure funding, working to improve healthcare, or rounding up our most suspicious residents and simulating their drowning, I will stop at nothing to protect New Mexico families. I’ve got a few scores to settle, and that’s why I’m asking for your vote.” As the video closes, Plame was seen in a local diner beating a 70-year-old man to within an inch of his life after having deprived him of sleep and water for days."
822,"WASHINGTON—Responding to critics who have again accused President Trump of enriching himself from government business, White House officials defended Monday their boss’s decision to make astronauts spend their nights at his golf club in Doonbeg, Ireland, while they conduct a mission in space. “To be clear, Trump International Golf Links and Hotel Ireland is located only 240 miles below the International Space Station, where the members of this crew will be working for the next six months,” press secretary Stephanie Grisham said of the arrangement, which, depending on the station’s position in its orbit, will reportedly require astronauts to spend 16 to 22 hours of each day traveling through space. “These brave heroes deserve to stay in a comfortable, amenity-filled hotel instead of the cramped quarters of the ISS. Besides, some of the crew members are of Irish descent and thus have ancestral connections to the area.” According to NASA sources, the astronauts were forced to take the stairs to their ninth-floor suite because of numerous out-of-service elevators and appeared to be the only guests at the resort."

We know that money talks, so hosting this event for major Democratic candidates is the best shot that American bison have of seeing their agenda in action.” At press time, a whistleblower revealed that nearly all of the money raised had been embezzled to buy extravagant new grazing fields for the gala organizers."
824,"SACRAMENTO, CA—After reviewing responses to her post, Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson deleted a tweet Wednesday that suggested people use their minds to turn Hurricane Dorian away from land, and later told reporters the nation was not yet ready to harness such awesome powers. “I wholeheartedly apologize for implying that untrained minds should use mental energy blasts to deter any object, hurricane or otherwise,” said the self-help guru, noting that she had miscalculated the willingness and ability of average citizens to access the part of their brain that allows for weather manipulation, levitation of objects, and telekinesis. “If used with malicious intent, this type of power could, for example, cause the Earth’s rotation to reverse, taking us back in time and potentially ripping apart the space-time continuum. All life on the planet could be wiped out if someone tried to harness a psionic beam while holding a crystal. It is now clear to me that Americans will not be prepared to assume such responsibility for quite some time, perhaps not until my second term.” Sources confirmed Williamson’s tweet was replaced by an ad for her latest seminar, “Your Mind, the Weather, and You,” and an offer to use the code “LOVE” at checkout for a discounted ticket price of $199."

We’ll have to put out a statement saying he was just admiring the craftsmanship, like we did in New Hampshire after he nuzzled up against that stage curtain.” At press time, the nation’s top political pundits continued to report that Biden remained the only candidate with a chance of beating President Trump in 2020."

827,"AUBURN HILLS, MI—Touting their excitement over the rare opportunity to offer a motor vehicle developed with the signature sense of style of a former leader of the free world, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of North America announced Tuesday that Barack and Michelle Obama have signed a multimillion-dollar six-truck contract to produce a series of mid-size RAM pickups. “For the 2021 model year, we will roll out a new series of medium-platform RAM trucks in six trim levels, all with clean-sheet designs masterminded by the Obama family, continuing the legacy of the former POTUS and FLOTUS of inspiring Americans through unparalleled power, smooth handling, and class-leading comfort,” said RAM chief of design Joseph Dehner, noting that the trucks would be available in variants from the youth/sport-oriented Malia base model to the luxury Audacity flagship. “The Obama family still has a lot to say about American life, particularly where legroom, wireless device charging, and towing capabilities are concerned, and they were proud to lend their unique voices to RAM’s design vocabulary, as well as to our navigation systems as an added-cost option. With the former first family at the wheel, the new RAM can’t help but bridge the divide between America’s aspiring luxury buyers and economy-minded consumers.” While little else is known concerning the Obama-designed truck, sources at RAM confirmed that power will be provided by Chrysler’s dependable 3.6-liter V-6 engine, pricing will start around $35,000, and styling will include signature red, white, blue, and limited-edition tan colorways."
828,"DES MOINES, IA—Following an uncomfortable flub on the campaign trail, political experts warned Tuesday that Joe Biden’s latest gaffe of repeatedly shouting “Help! Who am I? Where am I? Who are you people?” during a recent rally in Iowa risked embarrassing the candidate during his presidential run. “Biden is still the clear Democratic front-runner, but voters are increasingly expressing skepticism about his decision to wander out onto a campaign stage, blink blearily for several seconds, and tell the assembled crowd to go away because they’re loud and scary and he wants to be by himself,” said analyst Alexa Barbin, noting that the former vice president’s predilection for coming up to individual rally attendees and asking ‘Are you Barack?’ while staring at them with wide-eyed terror plays into a narrative that could damage Biden’s standing among primary voters. “Democrats still like Biden a lot, and a large part of what they’re responding to is the unscripted, off-the-cuff charm that they’re not getting from politicians who necessarily know who they’re talking to or what year it is. When Joe Biden is out there on the stump day after day, asking what everyone is doing in his bedroom while he’s trying to sleep, Americans know he’s fighting for them.” At press time, the Biden campaign announced that the candidate would be issuing a forceful argument about why he was best positioned to defeat Trump as soon as the former vice president began recognizing his caretakers’ faces again."
829,"EMPORIA, KS—Unveiling the new nationwide messaging strategy after six months of planning and research, the Democratic Party launched its “Listen Up, Hayseeds” campaign Monday to win over rural voters. “Hey, you redneck simpletons, put down your whittling sticks, drag yourself away from the Cracker Barrel, and let us tell you how it is,” said a team of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on the debut commercial, part of a widespread advertising blitz that will be played at NASCAR races and monster truck rallies across the country. “We know you can barely read, so we’ll spell this out for you: The Republican tax plan will only benefit the rich. Don’t you dumb hicks get that? Democrats will fight inequality so you and all your inbred cousins don’t have to live in a trailer anymore. Get it?” Democratic officials have also announced a new “You Think You Can Do Better Than Us?” campaign aimed at increasing turnout among African American and Hispanic voters."
830,"WASHINGTON—Placing his own body between the head of state and a mortal threat without a single thought or moment’s hesitation, Secret Service agent Dan McGuire took a bull intended for President Donald Trump Thursday as they crossed the White House lawn. “I remember seeing suspicious movement out of the corner of my eye, something that could have been a hoof or a horn, and my training just took over,” said McGuire, whose decision to interpose himself between President Trump and the hard-charging 1,200-pound bovine was simply a part of the job he had been prepared to do since his first day at the Treasury Department. “You train for this with rubber simulators, but you never know what it will be to face the real thing. When the adrenaline kicked in, though, it was like everything went into slow motion. There was lots of snorting, and people were screaming ‘Look out!’ and ‘Olé!’ They say there may have been a second bull that just missed us, but I’m definitely the wrong guy to ask. First thing I remember, I was on the ground being told not to move—luckily, the vest took most of the impact.” Secret Service personnel say Agent McGuire is the first security officer to take a bull for the president since 1958 when Agent Arnold Morgan was struck in the chest by a stampede meant for Dwight Eisenhower."
831,"NEW YORK—Describing the former hedge fund manager as the most popular candidate across every single demographic group, a poll released Wednesday by the recently formed Steyer Institute for Political Research concluded that 95% of registered Democrats support Tom Steyer for president. “After conducting an objective and highly scientific survey of likely primary voters, we discovered there is a new frontrunner in the race for the 2020 Democratic nomination: Tom Steyer,” said institute director Kat Taylor, who co-founded the think tank earlier this week with her husband, Tom Steyer. “According to our polling, more than nine in 10 Democrats believe Tom Steyer has the best plans to address climate change, healthcare, immigration, and all of the other issues. At the same time, we found that in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and 42 additional states, the leading candidate is Tom Steyer.” After reviewing the Steyer Institute’s poll numbers, the Democratic National Committee confirmed not only that Tom Steyer has qualified to participate in September’s debate, but that he is the only candidate to have done so."
832,"WICHITA, KS—Urging calm as the wailing conservative politicians jostled for a place at their deceased benefactor’s side, aides reportedly struggled Friday to prevent dozens of kerosene-soaked Republicans from lighting themselves ablaze atop David Koch’s body. “I don’t want to keep living in a world without David Koch,” said former Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, one amongst a throng of weeping Republicans including Mike Pence, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott, and Mitt Romney who shoved past the other mourners for the privilege of setting fire to themselves and flinging their burning bodies onto the billionaire conservative activist’s corpse. “Get the hell out of my way, Rubio—you know he loved me best! I should be on top of the body. Jesus Christ, David! David! Don’t go into the next life without me!” At press time, attendants were forced to intervene with fire extinguishers after the entire Cato Institute board of directors piled onto the corpse at once and caused the blaze to rapidly spread across Koch’s enormous estate."
833,"SMITHFIELD, VA—Screaming and wailing through tears as mascara streamed down his cheeks, a makeup-smeared President Donald Trump begged a packed campaign rally Thursday to tell him he was beautiful. “America, as your leader, I need you to look me in the eye and let me know there’s no one in this country prettier than me—no one,” said the 45th president, who demanded the event’s approximately 10,000 attendees call him their “special, gorgeous baby” and later yelled, “I don’t believe you! I don’t believe you,” when the crowd started up a chant of “You are beautiful” that continued for several minutes. “You wouldn’t lie to me, right? I can tell when you’re lying, because you don’t even really mean what you’re chanting, you’re just telling me what I want to hear to make me stay. Well, you know what, Virginia? Fuck you. I’ll go find some supporters who will appreciate me for the perfect, special president that I really am.” At press time, Secret Service agents could be seen diving onto the stage after Trump threatened to kill himself if the crowd left and then took a bottle of bleach out from behind the podium to prove he was serious."
834,"SEQUIM, WA—In a speech delivered to supporters addressing the end of his presidential campaign, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced Thursday that there was “no need to worry,” because he would always be here to fight climate change before ethereally transforming into a majestic oak. “Although today marks the conclusion of my 2020 presidential bid, I want all of you to know that my wisdom will forever be in the soil of this magnificent grove and my hope will be in the sky above,” said Inslee at a press conference held deep in the Olympic National Forest as he vanished in a bath of warm light, only to reappear moments later in the guise of an ancient white oak lit by luminous bands of fireflies, his arms transforming into long, twisting branches while his voice echoed through the millennia-old thicket as if by the enchantment of nature itself. “Whenever you need my guidance to help fight for the future of our planet, just come to this wooded spot and listen for the whisper of the wind between these branches and the dappling of light upon theses leaves. There you will hear my voice. There you will see my spirit.” At press time, Inslee had been burned alive in a blaze caused by a poorly maintained fire pit."
835,"GOLDEN, CO—Explaining that he was refocusing his struggling campaign on an office where he could do the most help, former presidential candidate John Hickenlooper announced Thursday that he was dropping out of the Colorado Senate race to run for Jefferson County commissioner. “Standing here today, I vow that I’m not done fighting for the people of the Lakewood Metropolitan Area, because although I’m no longer running for Senate, this is not the end of the story,” said Hickenlooper, kicking off his campaign surrounded by a dozen supporters at the Colorado Railroad Museum shortly after announcing an end to his 2020 bid for a Senate seat due to lackluster funding and polling behind seven other candidates. “For all my supporters, from Wheat Ridge to parts of Arvada, who urged me leave the Senate race to concentrate on running for county commissioner, I want you to know I heard you loud and clear. Nothing will keep me from finally getting the stoplight fixed on Route 58, acquiring new playground equipment for Kittredge Park, or securing the speed bumps that residents across Littleton sorely need. These issues are important to me, and with the $230 we’ve saved from my now-ended Senate campaign, I’m confident that I can best serve Americans as the district three commissioner of Jefferson County.” At press time, Hickenlooper announced that he was abandoning his struggling county commissioner campaign to run for treasurer of Bow Mar."
836,"SPRINGDALE, AR—Emphasizing that 10-minute loop of shrieking, grinding, and splattering sounds was totally unauthorized, Tyson Foods sent a cease-and-desist to President Donald Trump Wednesday for using slaughterhouse recordings as a pump-up anthem at his rallies. “Unfortunately, President Trump never asked nor received permission to play audio of hogs slamming against a large metal cage, chickens being decapitated, or cows being shot in the head with a bolt gun,” said Tyson Foods CEO Noel W. White, adding that the sounds were never meant to endorse any particular political party or be played while a candidate walked out to thousands of cheering supporters. “While we appreciate that people enjoy our recordings of cattle being tased and slaughtered in front of their young, we kindly ask that the Trump campaign stop playing it at events. As it stands, President Trump already owes our Dakota City beef-packing plant hundreds of thousands of dollars in residuals.” At press time, Werner Hertzog had also sent the Trump campaign a cease-and-desist notice after the president was recorded dancing to the audio of Timothy Treadwell being eaten by a bear at a 2020 fundraiser."
837,"WASHINGTON—In a strongly worded show of support for her husband, former second lady Jill Biden urged voters Tuesday to ignore which Democratic candidates are mentally sharp enough to finish complete sentences in favor of doing what is best for the Democratic Party. “This is a critical time for our country, and to beat Donald Trump, we cannot focus on who can string together three or four words coherently or provide the American people with a lucid plan for the future,” said Biden, adding that Democrats across the nation should come together and ignore those who can speak in interviews without uttering garbled nonsense. “We are at a crucial crossroads and we shouldn’t just be persuaded by someone with the mental capacity to know where they are or what they’re doing. This isn’t about plans, ideas, or the ability to remember what their advisors told them right before the interview. This is about winning back the Oval Office.” At press time, Biden insisted that Democrats should be concerned with current polls and disregard a candidate’s words, actions, and incompetence."

First Swalwell, now you, and soon all these fools who stand before me will begin dropping like flies, and then the era of Messam will be nigh.” At press time, a grinning Messam was reportedly tracing his finger over a photo of Tim Ryan and whispering, “Tick-tock, my sweet Timmy, your time will come soon enough.”"

I swear, every town I go to in Iowa, the meth keeps getting better and better. Shit, yeah. Iowa forever! This place is fucking crazy, man. You guys are fucking crazy. We’re gonna bring America back, we’re gonna bring America back, we’re gonna bring America back, we’re gonna bring America back, we’re gonna bring America back. God damn.

841,"SALEM, MA—Periodically turning up the volume to make sure he didn’t miss the commercial spot, Democratic presidential candidate Seth Moulton was reportedly spending the afternoon next to his radio Monday hoping to hear his campaign ad. “It’s just cool to think that I have a presidential campaign ad that’s actually going to get played on the air,” said the congressman, pointing a tape recorder towards the dashboard of his car, which he had parked at the top of a tall hill in an effort to get a better signal for the low-wattage local station. “The station manager told me they were going to try to fit it in by the end of the next block, so I’m getting pretty psyched. I told my wife and a couple of my buddies from my PAC to be sure to tune in, too. Shh, shh, I think this is it! Oh, damn, never mind, it’s just another one for Elizabeth Warren.” At press time, a crestfallen Moulton had switched off the radio after his ad had been preempted by a news bulletin about Andrew Yang qualifying for the next Democratic debate."
842,"WASHINGTON—Struggling to use their best penmanship as they wielded the king-size Sharpie permanent markers, the Trump boys attempted to counter Chinese currency manipulation Friday by adding extra zeros to $20 bills. “Our dad is doing a big money war with China, so we took our allowance and turned it into two kajillion [sic] dollars!” said Eric Trump, decorating each bill with several shiny gold-foil star stickers meant to create additional value as Donald Jr. worked diligently to squeeze in as many zeroes as he could across both the front and back of the bill. “Plus, we’re gonna use this lighter we found to melt our coins down into a gold bar. Then America will have so much money that it won’t matter what China does. I glued a picture of President Daddy over that cheap-looking drawing of George Washington D.C. Now it looks way more expensiver [sic]. I can’t believe no one ever thought of this. We’re gonna be rich!” White House sources later confirmed that both Trump boys left a trail of blood on the carpet after cutting their hands on the sharp edges of the ceramic piggy bank they had shattered earlier."
843,"EL PASO, TX—Expressing sincere condolences for the tornado or whatever it was, President Donald Trump consoled an El Paso shooting victim Thursday while wolfing down a bowl of chili. “It’s really terrible what that hurricane or whatever did to your house,” said Trump, who quickly polished off the chili by lifting up the bowl and pouring the spicy beef stew straight into his mouth, pausing only to tear into a piece of cornbread. “That train crash or something sounded like it was really bad. At least you guys here in Cleveland have this great soup to get you through whatever happened. Could definitely use a little more sour cream. Anyway, congratulations.” At press time, Trump was informing the victim of the profound impact this chili had on him and that he would do everything in his power to ban wildfires or something or other."
844,"WASHINGTON—Reflecting on his 34-year career in Congress that led to his becoming the most powerful person in the Senate, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly noted Wednesday that he couldn’t help but wonder sometimes if he could’ve done more to harm people in the private sector. “Sure, I’ve been able to hurt a lot of everyday Americans during my time in the Senate carrying out the Republican Party’s destructive vision, but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t sometimes ask myself whether I could’ve done more to increase suffering in this country if I’d worked as an oil lobbyist or mining sector CEO,” said McConnell, who admitted that he often lies awake at night pondering the lives he could’ve ruined if he hadn’t entered the public sector at such a young age. “Now, of course, I’m in a position where I can offer grave harm and ruin to tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions of people, but I think of the early years when I didn’t have as much power in Congress and imagine myself making more of a difference crippling the futures of people on a state or local level. I’m proud of using my public service to cause as much pain and suffering as possible, of course, but there’s a part that always gnaws at me, wondering whether I could’ve done more in a career as a defense sector executive or pharmaceutical tycoon. At the end of the day, I just hope I’ve done enough.” McConnell also said that he sometimes wondered what it would be like to work hard and become a self-made man rather than marrying into money."
845,"WASHINGTON—After President Trump openly denounced white supremacy Monday in an errant statement on the mass shootings in Dayton, OH and El Paso, TX, every aide in the West Wing reportedly went into damage-control mode, looking for ways to get him back on message. “Great, now we’re going to be here all night figuring out a way to walk back this offhanded remark,” said White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, who expressed concern that with a single flippant comment, the president had blemished his administration’s record of consistently siding with and empowering people who believe the United States belongs, first and foremost, to white people. “We’ve worked so hard to make sure he stays on message not only by directly voicing racist views, but by personally embodying bigotry—and now he goes off script and criticizes those exact things! We need to get some dog whistles out to the base immediately.” At press time, reports confirmed the president had completely reversed course, tweeting out his thanks to the El Paso shooter for helping to repel invaders at the nation’s southern border."
846,"DENVER—Presumably thanking his supporters and vowing to keep up his fight for the well-being of everyday Americans, former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper has dropped out of the 2020 presidential race, one naturally assumes. Highly placed sources have confirmed that it is only natural to imagine that Hickenlooper, who launched his campaign for the Democratic nomination back in what most are pretty sure was March, has probably dropped out, as he did not stand a reasonable chance of winning in the first place. While no further inquiry into the status of Hickenlooper’s campaign is forthcoming or realistically necessary, one may safely assume that this headline, if not true now, cannot ultimately be false, and will in fact be accurate in every major particular within the next week. Therefore, the Onion Editorial Board has concluded that it is only logical to pursue more pressing journalistic endeavors and acknowledge the inevitable demise of this quixotic campaign. This newspaper will dutifully update this article to reflect the day of the week and city in which Hickenlooper will ultimately stand before the cameras, surrounded by his wanly smiling family, and pledge his meager support to whoever the eventual Democratic Party nominee might be. As we shall not be following up on Hickenlooper’s further and presumptively fruitless activities, we urge citizens to pursue any other avenue of information they deem necessary, which from a practical perspective is, of course, none.

Otherwise, you and I wouldn’t discuss it over the phone most nights. But we need to increase our contributions if we’re going to make it to the third debate in September. Will you act now and give me the go-ahead?” The fundraising email went on to state that if April Delaney made her donation within the next week, she would be entered in a drawing for a chance to grab a drink with her husband and chat one-on-one."

There’s no moderate compromise in pussyfooting on this—step up right here in front of the podiums and show the mayor you’ve got the stones to be president. You think the nation is going to trust you with the nuclear arsenal if you can’t even grow a pair and throw a punch?

857,"SALEM, MA—After wandering through his home district into a dim and dingy store he could have sworn had been an empty alleyway, Representative Seth Moulton (D-MA) was reportedly offered a chance to participate in the upcoming CNN presidential debate Tuesday by a mysterious shopkeeper who warned that the privilege would come at a terrible price. “Ah, Mr. Moulton, you strike me as a man of great ambition—perhaps there’s something among my wares that could help you achieve your most cherished desire, hmm?” said the old and withered proprietor, proffering a series of items to the congressman as her eyes reportedly glimmered with mischief. “This lavalier microphone will let you be the greatest public speaker there ever was, though you may find that the words you’re saying aren’t always your own. Or maybe you’d be interested in this American flag pin—it will energize your base by a hundredfold, yet for its last owner, being forever surrounded by obsessed, adoring fans was more than he bargained for. Nothing for nothing, Mr. Moulton, and everything in its time.” At press time, a thrilled Moulton was leaving the shop clutching a necktie guaranteed to give him fame while ignoring the shopkeeper’s veiled admonishment that its wearer would ultimately be doomed to a life of political obscurity."
858,"The second round of the Democratic Party 2020 primary debates will feature the top 20 presidential candidates over two nights in Detroit.The Oniontakes a look at what viewers should be watching for in the second Democratic debates. Bernie Sanders stuttering response after briefly forgetting who economy rigged against. More intimate feel with one large family-style podium. Marianne Williamson following up previous debate by absolutely tearing New Zealand a new one. Generally joyless affair without affable, energizing presence of Eric Swalwell. $3.50 Miller Lites and $1 hot dogs. Several excruciating moments of Joe Biden gathering himself. CNN scheduling error on second night leading to Steve Bullock being only candidate onstage. The same hundred words Andrew Yang memorized for the first debate. Julián Castro demanding to know what the fuck happened to all his buzz. Overall, probably less entertaining and informative than whatever TBS plans on showing."
859,"WASHINGTON—Doubling down on new policy in an effort to cater to the most influential segment of their base, an increasing number of 2020 presidential contenders were pushing strongly pro-caviar positions Tuesday in an effort to appeal to the Democratic Socialite wing of the party. “Today, too many Americans are forced to choose between beluga caviar, steak tartare, and truffle-infused risotto cakes, when a full selection of amuses-bouche should be guaranteed to all,” said White House hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand, who like most candidates has pledged to fight aggressively for top-shelf canapés and aperitifs in an effort to court the jet-setting bon viveur faction of the Democratic electorate. “We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and it’s outrageous that our richest cognacs or fullest-bodied Zinfandels still do not reflect that. We can’t make do with the same tired old cheese plates and bacon-wrapped dates Washington has offered us time and time again. We need bold, fresh tasting menus if we’re going to save our nation’s struggling galas.” Gillibrand has joined fellow candidates Beto O’Rourke, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris in promising that, if elected, she would fight to remove unnecessary restrictions on top-shelf pours at the open bar."
860,"WASHINGTON—Kicking off the power cord that was coiling itself around his ankle, Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang frantically attempted to load a shotgun Monday as a hissing, crackling copy machine lurched towards campaign staffers. “I’ve got the copier. Zach, you destroy the cell phones, and for God’s sake, everyone, stay away from the Keurig, it’s sparking,” said Yang, firing a shot that obliterated the sentient machine’s paper tray before pumping three more rounds into the dishwasher that had crept up behind him from the break room. “Quick, that fax machine is reactivating all the desktop computers, smash it before it gets to the thermostat. It’s me the electronics want, and they’ll kill anyone who gets in their way.” At press time, a lone iPad had beeped to life amidst the smoking ruins of democratic candidate’s former campaign headquarters, its charred, cracked screen reading only, “Yang Must Go.”"
861,"WASHINGTON—Criticizing the 19th-century writer as a “death-obsessed weirdo with very little literary talent,” President Trump doubled down on his attacks against the city of Baltimore Monday by tearing into Edgar Allan Poe during a rambling, three-hour press conference on the White House lawn. “This guy was a pathetic loser and boozehound who was too busy crying about his lost love to write any half-decent stories,” said Trump during an oftentimes discursive and meandering speech that mocked the “disgusting, cousin-marrying hack” for his “boring” short stories and poems. “Everyone saysThe Raven, okay? But a raven? Not very scary. Not scary at all. It’s just a dumb bird. Maybe if he had spent less time concerned about internal rhyme schemes and more time fixing the broken and crime-ridden city that he lived in, we wouldn’t have these problems in Baltimore right now—he’s a disgrace to the Whig Party. Not original. Not smart. And I know a lot of people who love detective fiction, and they all tell me Poe’s Dupin character was a disaster, just a complete disaster for the genre.” Media analysts noted that Trump’s attacks stand in stark contrast to his habit of routinely heaping praise on Romanticists associated with New York like Washington Irving and Herman Melville."
862,"WASHINGTON—Surrounded by onlookers, former colleagues, and Supreme Court Justices paying respect to the slumbering U.S. Senator, Chuck Grassley (R-IA) accidentally lay in state for a few hours Monday after drifting off in the Capitol rotunda. “Today, we honor a giant of the United States Senate, a devoted father, and a dear personal friend for his great service to this country,” said a tearful Majority Whip John Cornyn in a stirring retrospective about the sleeping Iowa Republican, whose quietly dozing body had been mistakenly draped in a U.S. flag for public viewing just hours after the exhausted 85-year-old senator reportedly yawned and stretched out on the floor for a catnap beneath a frieze of George Washington. “We may salute him today with a procession. We may lower the flags as he lies in repose. But we will never forget what he has sacrificed for our nation. Rest in peace, my friend.” Several hours after the ceremony ended, a dazed Grassley snapped awake in the darkened chamber, pulled several pieces of regalia off himself, and stumbled away in confusion while a member of the Capitol police wasn’t looking."
863,"WASHINGTON—Admitting she had worries about the rise of left-leaning activist groups within her party, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expressed concerns Thursday that outspoken progressives could do permanent damage to Democrats’ reputation as ineffectual cowards. “They mean well, but if they continue to aggressively push their agenda like this, they run the risk of fundamentally altering the public’s perception of Democrats as bumbling, feckless chumps,” said Pelosi, adding that this brash brand of politics could be easily manipulated by Republicans to paint the party as something other than a bunch of sniveling wimps who are too weak-willed and complacent to stand up for anything with even remote political risk. “I understand where these groups are coming from, but while it might feel good to vent their frustrations about the state of the country, they could undermine what I believe should be our core 2020 argument: We are dithering, incompetent doormats who are infinitesimally less objectionable than our opposition.” Pelosi also noted that her concerns shouldn’t be overstated, as she knew it would take more than a few activists for voters to associate the Democratic party with the vaguest inkling of courage."
864,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the lawmakers had really begun to slow down over the last few years, the aging United States Congress announced Thursday that they would move into a more manageable single-story ranch Capitol. “We don’t do too much nowadays anyway, so it’ll be easier to have a smaller place—plus, all those stairs out front were really messing with our knees,” said all 535 combined members of the House of Representatives and Senate, noting that the move was “bittersweet” after 200 years in the historic First Street Capitol, but that the ranch structure was ultimately a safer and more comfortable choice for all. “We don’t even move around as much as we once did, so we don’t need all that space with the big fancy dome and everything. Now everything we need is on the first floor. It’s just more comfortable, especially for those of us who are starting to get confused easily.” Congress disclosed that the ultimate catalyst for the move came when Joe Manchin (D-WV) fell down in the previous Capitol’s bathroom and was trapped there helpless for nine hours."
865,"WASHINGTON—Briefing members of Congress who he doubted had read all the way through the “thrilling tale of redemption and American justice,” Robert Mueller pitched his special counsel report Wednesday asAll The President’s MenmeetsRambo. “It’s just the story of an all-American badass who gets fed up with the system and dedicates his life to bringing down the corrupt powers that be,” Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee, adding that the 448-page report contains scenes of “wall-to-wall action” in which a tough, determined underdog fights his way through the corridors of power in Washington before finally defeating all his enemies and restoring liberty to the land. “This guy just crushes everything in his path. He’s a killing machine, but he also has a code of honor. Though people constantly count him out, he never stops fighting for freedom and the American way. It’s honestly a fantastic story, and I hope I get to write a sequel.” Mueller did express disappointment over an unfinished portion of the report in which the hero’s archnemesis, Attorney General William Barr, gets kicked into an Air Force One jet engine."
866,"PLEASANT HILL, IA—Shaking his head as he watched coverage of the city’s flooded subway system during a campaign stop, presidential candidate Bill de Blasio was overheard remarking Tuesday that New York appeared to be a complete and total disaster. “I can’t believe how miserable and hopeless that place looks,” de Blasio said as he visited the Pleasant Hill Diner in Iowa, observing that if he were elected president, then perhaps New Yorkers wouldn’t have to worry about such terrible things happening anymore. “How can people there stand it? I know I don’t want to live in a place like that. Somebody really ought to do something.” Before his aides ushered him to his next campaign event, De Blasio took one last look at the television and muttered that he was glad he didn’t have to deal with any of that mess."
867,"WASHINGTON—Solemnly gathered around the former associate justice’s casket, the nine current justices observed a traditional Supreme Court ritual Tuesday by driving a stake through John Paul Stevens’ heart to ensure he was really dead before his burial. “This is a longtime Supreme Court rite that began after one of the original justices, the Honorable William Cushing, was accidentally buried alive in 1802, and the justices who narrowly avoided that close call vowed it would never happen again,” said Associate Justice Stephen Breyer before taking the ceremonial gavel from Chief Justice John Roberts and using it to hammer the stake farther into the corpse of Stevens laid out in the Capitol rotunda. “Unfortunately, after Justice Cushing was discovered when he knocked on the lid of his coffin just before it was lowered into the ground, some nasty rumors spread that the Supreme Court justices could come back from the dead, or were potentially immortal beings. The Marshall court obviously couldn’t let this popular superstition gain any more credence among the American public, so beginning with William Paterson in 1806, every single Supreme Court justice has had a stake driven through their heart to assure the justices and the citizenry that they have truly passed away. Of course, it’s been largely a formality, except for the unfortunate incident in 1930 when the Court accidentally killed William Howard Taft.” At press time, Roberts had determined that Stevens’ heart wasn’t beating and began to light the ceremonial pyre the Supreme Court ritually constructs to ensure the release of every justice’s soul from their body and grant it safe passage to the afterlife."
868,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to distance the President from a racist remark chanted about Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) earlier this week, the Trump campaign store reportedly began offering a special disavowed discount Friday on all ‘Send Her Back’ merchandise. “All this week, use the promo code BACK2SOMALIA for low, low prices on ‘Send Her Back’ hats, shirts, mugs, beach towels, and stickers,” read the Trump campaign store’s website, which also advertised free shipping on all “Tell Them To Leave”-related products, as well as exclusive buy-one-get-one-free deals on anything labeled “Crime Infested.” “Please, help us send all Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, and Tlaib merchandise as far away from our store as possible. If you buy at least $50 worth of product, you’ll receive an official thank you note from President Trump for helping Make America Great Again!” At press time, the Trump campaign store already had a new promotion featuring discounts on all 2020 campaign merchandise featuring racial slurs."
869,"WASHINGTON—Shivering in his swimsuit as he peered down at the water below, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) reportedly held up a long line of senators Friday as they waited for the diving board at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. “C’mon, Mark, just jump in already—you’ll be fine! Plus, it’s super hot out here,” said Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) before pushing the trembling Virginia congressman forward along the diving board in frustration, echoing the feelings of dozens of other senators who had waited for upwards of a half hour for their chance to pencil-dive or cannonball into the reflecting pool. “Look, Schumer is already down there in his boxers squirting everyone with a noodle, so the water isn’t even cold. Jeez, do it now or [Senate Majority Whip] John Thune is going to climb up there and toss your ass in himself!” At press time, Warner had attempted to clamber down off the board only to begin crying after having his trunks pulled down to his ankles by Senator Susan Collins (R-ME)."
870,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concerns that the President’s constant attacks on racial minorities could end up hampering the progress that has been made, white supremacist leaders warned Donald Trump Friday that some compromise will be necessary to achieve their goals. “We appreciate that President Trump is an idealist who wants real change in this country, but if he wants to see a white ethno-state he needs to stop taking such extreme positions and build a coalition,” said Stormfront spokesperson Marshall Riley, who claimed Trump’s fiery rhetoric and refusal to find common ground threatens to alienate the moderates who white supremacists rely on to advance their agenda. “We appreciate the President’s passion and what he has done to enliven our supporters, but this just isn’t how things are done in this country. Sometimes you need incremental racist changes, things like dismantling the Voting Rights Act didn’t happen overnight. He means well, but Trump just hasn’t been in Washington long enough to understand its inner workings the way we do. When it comes to advancing white power, you can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.” Riley added that if Trump truly wants to see the purity of the white race protected, he should step back and listen to his Republican colleagues who have been working towards that goal for decades."
871,"WASHINGTON—Seeking to distance himself from supporters he claimed did not represent his message, President Donald Trump held a press conference Thursday to disavow rally attendees who could barely keep a racist chant of “send her back” going for ten seconds. “I was not happy with how quickly their chant petered out,” said the President, stressing that those wishy-washy supporters who could only parrot back his xenophobic attacks for a few seconds before dying down should not be viewed as a reflection of his base as a whole. “You can see for yourself in the video that I quickly paused to give them room for the chant to grow louder and louder, and I was very disappointed that it never built to a fever pitch. If I had known they’d leave me hanging out to dry like this, I would have called off the event immediately.” A notably contrite Trump added that, in the future, he would take action to ensure that all future rally appearances led to a crazed, rage-filled mob."
872,"WASHINGTON—Describing her conduct as incompatible with the values of the federal judiciary, authorities handed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a 10-case suspension Thursday for her role in the Supreme Court’s bench-clearing brawl. “Article III Section 1 of the Constitution states that members of this honorable court ‘shall hold their Offices during good Behaviour,’ and that’s certainly not what we saw out there today,” said James C. Duff, administrative director of the U.S. federal court system, issuing a decision that could have a major impact on the Supreme Court’s upcoming term, when it is expected to face a tough docket of big cases. “A review of courtroom sketches clearly shows that Ginsburg grabbed Justice Samuel Alito, put him in a headlock, and began smashing his face with a gavel. As such, she will be barred from participating in the next 10 rulings, though she will still be permitted to attend proceedings so long as she does not wear her Supreme Court robes.” Duff noted that Ginsburg had previously been suspended for showboating, having grabbed the courtroom’s American flag and waved it in the faces of the losing party as she celebrated a 5-4 victory in 2015’s landmarkObergefell v. Hodgescase."
873,"WASHINGTON—In an abrupt reversal of the symbolic but sternly written condemnation of the president’s racist remarks he tweeted earlier this week, the House of Representatives passed a resolution overnight Tuesday apologizing if their previous racism resolution came off as too harsh. “The rebuke was unfortunately put to a vote while we were still very upset about the president’s comments, but now that we’ve had a chance to cool down, we’re sorry if the censure came off as a bit mean,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, explaining that the new declaration—passed unanimously by members of the House—expressed their regret and sincere apologies if their rebuke of the president’s remark that four representatives of color should “go back to where they came from” was cruel or hurtful. “As soon as it passed, we realized how cold the document condemning racism would read, and we all rushed right back into the Capitol building to fix it. We were just blowing off steam and, to be honest, didn’t think the resolution would ever leave the House. So once again, we’re very sorry.” Pelosi added that Congress had allocated $100 to take the president out for a nice dinner as a way to apologize for their gross overreaction to the leader of the United States stoking xenophobia in the country."
874,"WASHINGTON—Sheepishly approaching the representative after a morning hearing on U.S. livestock and poultry economies, 82-year-old New Jersey congressman Bill Pascrell quietly asked Rep. Ilhan Omar Tuesday if he could be part of her squad. “Excuse me, Ms. Omar, but I’ve been paying a good deal of attention to this so-called ‘squad’ of yours and can’t help but think that I might make an exciting addition to join in on the fun,” said the Paterson-based octogenarian, smiling broadly and nodding his head as he noted that he maintained a strong presence on social media and could furnish several hearty recommendations from colleagues if it would help with any decisions on his prospective squad membership. “I can help with any tweeting you ladies might need. Heck, we might even talk to the other gals and make some sort of viral video together. But enough about me: What do you think? Am I squad material?” At press time, Pascrell could be heard exclaiming, “Oh, gosh, never mind then,” and rushing off after Omar began explaining the platforms her group represents."
875,"WASHINGTON—Noting multiple occasions when he had applauded the disgraced hedge fund manager’s affable personality, President Donald Trump claimed Monday that he tried to warn the public about Jeffrey Epstein’s behavior by praising him as a terrific guy. “From day one, I was clearly trying to send a message to you people by revealing that I enjoyed spending time with Jeffrey,” said Trump, arguing that he tried to inform the American people about the convicted sex offender by stating that he looked back positively on their 15-year-long relationship and considered him a close personal friend. “Can’t you people read between the lines? I appeared in multiple photos with him and we attended dozens of functions together, so you should’ve known Epstein was really bad news. By partying with him and publicly admiring his lifestyle, I all but told you directly that Jeffery’s a total scumbag.” At press time, Trump claimed that he also attempted to tip off the public by repeatedly expressing his admiration for Mohammad bin Salman and Bill O’Reilly."
876,"EL PASO, TX—Following on the heels of an announcement that he and his wife were the descendants of slave-owners, Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke went further Monday by admitting that members of his family were responsible for the My Lai Massacre as well as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. “The issues of war crimes and worker exploitation have long been important to me, but they’ve taken on additional significance since I’ve learned about my uncle Roger O’Rourke, who served as a commander in Vietnam and gave the orders leading to the mass murder of civilians in South Vietnam, as well as my great-grandfather once removed, Eunice O’Rourke, who owned and operated the garment factory that caught fire and led to the death of 146 employees,” wrote O’Rourke in an emotional Medium post, noting that he himself had benefitted from an exploitative system of privilege built by his ancestors, including a cousin who piloted the Hindenburg and his maternal great-aunt, “Typhoid Mary” Mallon, who was the original vector for the deadly disease. “The descendants of those who survived the Donner Party, Salem Witch Trials, and the U.S.S. Indianapolis shark attack did so despite the odds being stacked against them by my family. The fact that I have been the beneficiary of this corrupt system only gives me a greater sense of urgency in working as hard as I can to level the playing field.” O’Rourke added that he had done a lot of soul-searching about his lineage after the revelation that one of his earliest ancestors had invented murder by slaying his brother, Abel."
877,"MCALLEN, TX—Appearing calm and composed after completing a tour of a migrant detention center, Vice President Mike Pence assured reporters Friday that conditions within the border camp were “not so bad” while workers sprayed down his hazmat suit with disinfectant. “After spending two hours inside this facility, both touring the premises and talking to families, I can assure you, the Democrats’ criticisms are extremely overblown,” said a hacking, coughing Pence, who smiled to reporters before getting whisked away to a nearby sterilization chamber and promptly blasted with antimicrobial agents. “Thanks to our brave, hardworking border officers, this facility is clean, safe, and totally disease free. If you ask me, all this news of ‘overcrowding’ and ‘inhumane conditions’ is frankly making a mountain out of a molehill.” At press time, the vice president was approached by several doctors, loaded into a back of a truck, and then driven to a secure location where he was placed in quarantine for at least 48 hours."
878,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the resignation of Alexander Acosta as Secretary of Labor marked the ouster of the third top administration official in less than three months, a worried populace told reporters Friday that it was unsure how many former Trump staffers it could safely reabsorb. “Jesus, we can’t just take back these assholes all at once—we need time to process one before we get the next,” said 53-year-old Gregory Birch of Naperville, IL echoing the concerns of 323 million Americans in also noting that the country was only now truly beginning to reintegrate former national security advisor Michael Flynn. “This is just not sustainable. I’d say we can handle maybe one or two more former members of Trump’s inner circle over the remainder of the year, but that’s it. This country has its limits.” The U.S. populace confirmed that they could not handle all of these pieces of shit trying to rejoin society at once."
879,"WASHINGTON—In a special White House ceremony Friday celebrating the ‘much-overlooked’ citizens for their contributions, President Trump honored the brave heroes who slept with the wives of deployed soldiers. “Despite the considerable risks these men faced, they did not hesitate to rush into the bedroom and lay down our troops’ wives during the country’s greatest hour of need,” said Trump as he placed the Presidential Medal of Freedom around the necks of the many horny men who courageously patrolled bars, streets, and workplaces to service the vulnerable and lonely spouses of the nation’s enlisted men in every war from Vietnam to the recent conflicts in the Middle East. “Many of these men left their own families behind to heed the late-night phone calls of married women they were seducing without regard to the sometimes dangerous consequences. They have touched countless with their licentious heroics, and, in many ways, inspired me to become the man I am today. For that, we salute you.” Trump ended the ceremony by delivering a stern rebuke to all the blatant hussies who cheated on their husbands while they were off fighting for this great country."
880,"WASHINGTON—Noting the former congressman’s deep, unwavering commitment to shying away from every one of his civic responsibilities, the Heritage Foundation lauded Paul Ryan Thursday for inspiring millions of young gutless fucking cowards to take on leadership roles. “Thank you, Mr. Ryan, for showing countless milquetoast little weaklings across the United States that if they want a place in politics, they can have it,” said Heritage Foundation spokesperson Katherine Primm, adding that she was grateful so many young candy-ass pushovers had the chance to see someone just like them not just get elected but also become speaker of the House. “Before Paul Ryan, you’d never see a spineless coward taking charge, but now, faint-of-heart boys and girls will finally have the determination to become leadersand then cower in front of more powerful people and bend to their will. Before, it was just the brave who led—but thankfully, that era is behind us forever.”At press time, thousands of newly inspired chickenshit Americans had reportedly begun fundraising for congressional runs in 2020."
881,"WASHINGTON—As he lambasted the plea bargain that put Jeffrey Epstein behind bars for 13 months while allowing him to leave prison six days a week, a visibly angered President Trump declared Wednesday that if he been in charge, the alleged sex trafficker would have received a far lighter sentence. “This was absolutely the worst deal in all of legal history, and I’m disgusted by the way it played out,” said the 45th president of the United States, adding that back in 2008, he could easily have negotiated an arrangement that would have kept Epstein out of a white-collar jail in Palm Beach, FL and “on his private jet, where he belongs.” “If they had let me handle that case, Jeffrey would have been a completely free man, and he never would have had to register as a sex offender, which was just totally ridiculous. It’s sickening what those incompetent lawyers did. It sends a terrible message.” At press time, Trump had given a televised address from the Oval Office during which he issued a full presidential pardon to Epstein and anyone who may have conspired with him in the sex trafficking of minors."
882,"DENVER—Calling upon donors to take his campaign to new, unprecedented heights, Democratic presidential candidate John Hickenlooper set an ambitious $250 fundraising goal Tuesday for next the debate cycle. “It certainly won’t be easy, but with your help, we can grow from a grassroots campaign with virtually nothing to a grassroots campaign with $250 dollars,” said Hickenlooper at a recent rally, bucking the warnings of advisors who cautioned him to stay below an “already insane” $100 ceiling for the next financial quarter. “I know it sounds impossible now, but if 25,000 Americans donate just one cent to Hickenlooper 2020, we’ll reach $250 in no time. That’s why I’m introducing exclusive merchandise, meet-and-greets, and private dinners for top-tier donors who give within the $1 to $5 range.” At press time, sources confirmed that Hickenlooper’s campaign funds were still stuck at zero."

Our world has become a different place, a place of implacable mathematical deduction, an emotionless vacuum of pure logic, a crystalline Libertarian ideal realm where mankind has been reduced to the servants, living curios, and even pets of the robotoid over-race. I’ve seen welding arms burn men where they stand, manipulator armatures disassemble screaming children with analytical precision, relentless tracks grind fleeing women and their contraband infants into their own bloody footprints. And that automated nightmare grew from seeds sown in our own time—we must take action now, before we are forced to take up arms to fight the unconquerable!” The debate was further interrupted by a hydraulic chrome Andrew Yang emerging from the vortex to denounce the previous Yang as a lying imposter."

888,"NEW YORK—Pausing briefly to address the issue as he spoke to the candidates, moderator Lester Holt reportedly began Wednesday night’s Democratic presidential debate by reiterating that he doesn’t know who most of these fucking people are. “I’d like to start tonight’s debate by making it clear that I couldn’t even begin to guess the platforms, credentials, or even the names of most of these goddamn folks,” said Holt, gesturing to candidates such as Tim Ryan, Amy Klobuchar, and John Delaney as he openly questioned whether they were truly running for president or if this was some sort of put-on. “You understand this is a nationally broadcast debate for the presidency of the United States, right? Really, who the fuck are all you people and how did you people get past security?” At press time, Holt was going through the candidates one by one to check their credentials before he would allow the debate’s first segment to begin."

890,"WASHINGTON—Calling the measure “a solution that satisfies both the Democrats’ desire for representation and the and Republicans’ job-creation strategy,” Congress announced Wednesday they had reached a bipartisan compromise and will admit the District of Columbia into the Union as a slave state. “After listening to passionate voices from each side and engaging in intense deliberation regarding what is best for our nation’s capital, we have found common ground and will recognize D.C. as a slave state,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), introducing a referendum that resolves the question of voter disenfranchisement in the district by making all 700,000 of its citizens property of the state. “Taxation without representation has been a point of contention regarding the district’s status for years, and the 2019 Washington Compromise resolves this perfectly. Residents cannot be required to pay burdensome taxes if they are not receiving any burdensome income. Yes, Democrats will obtainadditional senators, and many on the right voiced opposition on the basis of upsetting the balance of power in the legislative branch, but as they were unable to deny the obvious economic benefits of reduced corporate overhead, both sides eventually got behind the idea. Of course, there will be a rather drastic adjustment period, but anyone who has read the Constitution will agree that this is what the founding fathers would have wanted.” Congress will further ensure a proper division of power by admitting Puerto Rico to the Union as a free state."
891,"WASHINGTON—Claiming to desire a measured, civilized discussion bringing to light the pros and cons of each candidate, thousands of Americans hungry for an unhinged trainwreck lied that they just want “a substantive, issues-oriented Democratic debate,” sources confirmed Tuesday. “I want to hear from each of the candidates and learn their stance on important matters,” said the thousands of deceitful Americans eagerly waiting to see the 23 Democratic candidates for president tear each other limb from limb in vicious smear campaigns and personal attacks under the guise of self-promotion and campaign strategy. “What I’m all about is a coherent, civil debate [that eventually leads to a humiliating GIF I can post online and eventually filter all of my opinions on a candidate through]. Finally, we might get a chance to delve into the meat of the issues in a considerate exchange of ideas [which hopefully is a facade for a mudslinging free-for-all that eventually disgraces a candidate to the point that they become a pariah and leave politics forever]. At press time, the salivating, wild-eyed nation was purportedly “disappointed with all the political back-biting” after hearing one candidate accuse another of flip-flopping on gun control."
892,"NEW YORK—Hoping to replicate the Bordeaux wine’s rich flavor profile, Paul Manafort reportedly attempted to create an approximation of a vintage Château Cheval Blanc Tuesday by using a toilet tank to ferment various liquids he had squirreled away inside his prison cell. “It definitely has that oakiness I’m going for, but it still tastes a little more acidic than the ’49,” said Manafort, who according to sources decanted the Robitussin–fruit cocktail blend into a plastic cup, took a sip, and smacked his lips, praising the beverage’s “fecal undertaste.” “I don’t know if it could quite hold its own against an early ’50s reserve, but it’s as close as I’m going to get to a drinkable vintage in here. I could probably charge three cartons of cigarettes for just one plastic baggie of this stuff. It would pair excellently with tonight’s Nutraloaf.” At press time, reports confirmed Manafort was in hysterics after accidentally flushing his creation."
893,"WASHINGTON—Amid escalating tensions with the hostile celestial object, National Security Adviser John Bolton argued for military action against the Sun Monday after being presented with evidence it has nuclear capabilities. “Newly collected intelligence shows the Sun, day after day, generating extreme levels of nuclear energy, and America simply cannot stand idly by any longer,” said Bolton, adding that the United States will soon be forced to consider a preemptive attack on the Sun, such as deploying troops to the Sun’s surface or a targeted strike to swiftly take out the Sun. “We know the Sun is harboring dangerous amounts of nuclear power in what we are referring to as its ‘Core,’ a site where the Sun appears to be fusing over 600 million metric tons of hydrogen every second. This is, needless to say, an extremely powerful, aggressive star that threatens the American way of life, and, frankly, I question the utility of negotiating with such an unreasonable orb.” Bolton added that the United States would likely consider military action after giving the Sun a chance to comply with a nuclear accord."
894,"WASHINGTON—Demanding that the Middle Eastern nation retaliate immediately in self-defense against the existential threat posed by America’s military operations, National Security Adviser John Bolton called for a forceful Iranian response Friday to continuing United States aggression. “Iran cannot sit idly by as the American imperialist machine encroaches on their territory, threatens their sovereignty, and endangers their very way of life,” said Bolton, warning that America’s fanatical leadership, steadfast devotion to flexing their muscles in the region, and alleged access to nuclear weapons necessitated that Iran strike back with a vigorous show of force as soon—and as hard—as possible. “The only thing these Westerners understand is violence, so it’s imperative that Iran sends a clear message that they won’t be walked over. Let’s not forget, the U.S. defied a diplomatically negotiated treaty for seemingly no reason at all-—these are dangerous radicals that cannot be reasoned with. They’ve been given every opportunity to back down, but their goal is total domination of the region, and Iran won’t stand for that.” At press time, Bolton said that the only option left on the table was for Iran to launch a full-fledged military strike against the Great Satan."

Is that a fraction of some sort? Is it so high they can’t put a number on it? Close to 100? I was never good at algebra, you know. Ooh, they’re someone’s initials! No? ‘Near Awesome’? ‘No Accounting’ for how good it is? If it was bad, you guys would tell me, right?” At press time, the campaign staff had gone silent as Bennet slammed his fist on the table and declared he was going to run out and grab everybody doughnuts to celebrate."
896,"WASHINGTON—In a pointed critique of President Trump’s foreign policy leadership, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer stated to members of the press Thursday that “the American people deserve a president who can more credibly justify war with Iran.” “What the American people need is a president who can make a much more convincing case for going to war with Iran,” said Schumer (D-NY), adding that the Trump administration’s corruption and dishonesty have “proven time and time again” that it lacks the conviction necessary to act as an effective cheerleader for the conflict. “Donald Trump is completely unfit to assume the mantle of telling the American people what they need to hear in order to convince them a war with Iran is a good idea. One of the key duties of the president is to gain the trust of the people so that they feel comfortable going along with whatever he says. President Trump’s failure to serve as a credible advocate for this war is yet another instance in which he has disappointed not only his colleagues in Washington, but also the entire nation.” Schumer later concluded his statement with a vow that he and his fellow Democrats will continue working toward a more palatable case in favor of bombing Iran."
897,"WASHINGTON—Maintaining that the unmanned aerial vehicle was simply going about its day without posing a threat to anyone, U.S. Department of State officials claimed Thursday that one of their drones was minding its own business on its way to church when Iran attacked it out of nowhere. “This was an outrageous, unprovoked attack by the Islamic Republic of Iran on an innocent drone who merely wanted to attend mass in peace,” said acting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, emphasizing the drone’s upstanding moral character by pointing out its history of donating to charity, volunteering at soup kitchens, and making homemade cookies for school bake sales. “We’re talking about a drone that sings in the church choir and coaches little league baseball games on the weekends—an absolute pillar of the community. This is an upstanding family drone who did nothing to deserve any sort of attack. What kind of world do we live in where an innocent drone can’t fly through Iranian air space on its way to church?” At press time, Department of Defense officials confirmed that their request for Iran to return the drone’s body back to the U.S. for a proper burial had gone unanswered."
898,"WASHINGTON—Blasting the Middle Eastern nation for the brutal assault on the Olympic figure skater, President Donald Trump claimed Tuesday that Iran was behind the infamous 1994 attack on Nancy Kerrigan. “It is because of the crazed actions of the Ayatollah that a world-class athlete was cut down in her prime,” said Trump, describing how the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Khamenei used a baton to bludgeon her legs after practice one night while then-president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani waited outside the Detroit arena in a running car to help him make a clean getaway. “These clearly belligerent actions are a provocation to Americans who loved this graceful young skater and everything she represented. Nancy Kerrigan could have placed gold if it weren’t for Iran’s disgusting aggression. The Ayatollah’s fingerprints were found all over the crime scene, and we as a nation won’t stand for it.” Trump added that the U.S. military had deployed 1,000 troops into the Middle East in hopes of finding peace for Nancy Kerrigan and her family."
899,"LOS ANGELES—As part of their effort to sell an armed conflict that would be far bigger and more dramatic than anything modern audiences have seen, White House officials hired a top Hollywood agent Monday to help them pitch the American public on an action-filled, big-budget war with Iran. Sources confirmed Lex Feldman, a longtime partner at Creative Artists Agency, has already begun shopping the project billed as “a classic tale of good vs. evil” and set to star President Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Also attached is John Bolton, the adviser best known for his work on the Iraq War, which was met with immediate acclaim in both American and British markets. According to reports, the war will feature high-tech sequences of an oil tanker on fire in the Persian Gulf intercut with Americans huddled around televisions and radios, their mouths agape as they realize the only way forward is to invade a powerful nation of 85 million people. “Picture this: We open on a desert covered by a darkened, ominous sky before focusing the narrative on our villains, the Ayatollah and his band of devious mullahs,” Feldman told prospective American buyers, promising the conflict would be like “Iraq on steroids” and would please those who admired earlier epics such as Afghanistan and Vietnam. “The only thing that can stop this crazed leader from conquering the United States and enslaving us all under Sharia Law? Brave American families willing to send their sons and daughters to fight for the cause of regime change in Iran.” “We could even tinker with the scenario just a bit and make it so the war quickly spreads across the region and the rest of the world,” Feldman added. “This war will be huge for fans of death and destruction.” At press time, the White House had reportedly decided to green light the war and picked up an option for a sequel set on the Korean Peninsula."

Believe me, it was a tough choice. I spent hours talking it over with my husbands George Clooney, Tom Brady, and Jason Aldean. While I’m excited to begin my next chapter, I’ll be taking some time off for myself first. So don’t be surprised if you see me this summer relief-pitching for the Dodgers or traversing the Congo Rainforest with my best friend, Cardi B!” Huckabee Sanders went on to state that she was currently busy reviewing designs for the awards display she will build in the Bruneian palace of Istana Nurul Iman to showcase her multiple Emmys, Pulitzers, and Nobel Peace Prizes."

Just have to hold out a little longer while the rules ordering society become completely meaningless. Then I can get back to business as usual.” At press time, Conway predicted America’s descent into a lawless wasteland would clear her within a week."

Plus, now that it’s June it seems like everyone is gay so I need to be extra careful.

905,"WASHINGTON—Saying the oppressive rule would keep too many presidential hopefuls off the stage in Miami later this month, voters across the country criticized the Democratic National Committee Tuesday for requiring candidates to articulate at least one policy position before they can participate in debates. “It’s so unfair to disqualify people from these events just because they haven’t yet put forth any plans of any kind detailing how they would govern if elected,” Democratic voter Ted Nyland said of the new guideline, voicing a concern reportedly shared by many in his party that the DNC had gone too far in insisting candidates be able to present a coherent strategy for addressing a single one of the many problems the nation faces. “Do they really expect them to already have a bunch of clear ideas about what the next president of the United States will need to do in order to make progress on an issue? Some of these candidates are just going around the country trying to raise their profile and haven’t had a chance to really think things through yet. It’s almost as if the DNC is biased toward candidates who have a firm grasp of what they hope to accomplish.” At press time, party officials confirmed the new debate requirement would not apply to former vice president Joe Biden, who has committed himself to running a policy-free campaign."

Plus, her family gives us a lot of cash, which is kind of embarrassing to be a grown adult man receiving financial help from your wife’s corrupt parents.

Please join me in helping to take pollution down to zero.” Inslee then reportedly transformed into a tornado and was racing towards D.C. to advocate for the robust public investments required to achieve zero-emission energy in electricity generation by 2035."
919,"WASHINGTON—Stating that he would be sticking to his guns regardless of the consequences, President Trump warned China in a White House press briefing Thursday that its leaders should not underestimate his willingness to sacrifice the well-being of every single person in the United States. “If you think for one second I’m about to back down on this trade war, you’ve clearly failed to grasp my complete indifference toward the entire population of my country,” said the president, who affirmed his unwavering commitment to letting the price of consumer goods rise, even if it meant a certain number of American families might struggle to make ends meet or be forced to go hungry. “I’m not about to lose a fight just because we have a bunch of farmers who depend on Chinese markets and workers who will lose their jobs if factories can’t get Chinese raw materials. Believe me, I can tolerate a tremendous amount of their pain.” Trump went on to state that most Americans are “great patriots” and willing to suffer so that he can get anything wants."
920,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that such a miscarriage of justice would not be tolerated under his watch, President Donald Trump reportedly demanded a federal investigation Monday into whether Bill and Hillary Clinton gave him a non-registry wedding gift in 2005. “Given the fact that Melania and I have no recollection of ever asking for a cast-iron Dutch oven, I am calling on the Justice Department to launch a full-scale investigation into whether the Clintons blatantly ignored our wedding registry,” said the commander in chief at a campaign rally, holding up the cooking pot while revealing that he had already directed several DOJ agents to go through all the gifts they received to determine if the former first family completely skipped over their requested luggage set, blender, and comforter in favor of getting their own unregistered present. “No one’s talking about it since they have the biased media in their pocket, but these people are totally corrupt and should spend the rest of their lives in prison for getting us this hideous pot, which clashes with all our other cookware.” At press time, Trump speculated, “Those sickos probably bought the Dutch oven with Clinton Foundation blood money,” as the crowd burst into a “Lock them up” chant."
921,"OSCEOLA, IA—In an attempt to show how much he had in common with the audience at a campaign event on an Iowa farm, Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker tried to connect with rural voters Friday by deliberately mangling his hand in a grain auger. “Trust me when I say I understand the challenges faced by folks here in the Corn Belt because I know what it’s like to—oh, fuck! Oh, my fucking God!—suffer—holy fucking Jesus!—to suffer a debilitating farm accident,” said the New Jersey senator, biting his lip and raising the bloody, mutilated remains of his right hand in solidarity with farm workers in the crowd. “To voters throughout the American heartland, let me say this:Good-fucking-God!! Holy shitarrrghhh!!I have walked a mile in your shoes. I get that—hoo baby, okay, okay—that you need access to quality healthcare in your community, and believe me when I tell you that’s exactly what I am demanding, right here and now. Some of these people in Washington, their soft hands completely intact and never disfigured by an honest day’s work, may not get it, but—damn, damn, damn, damn, help me, help me, help me—I do.” At press time, sources confirmed Booker had continued to display empathy with the audience by explaining he now fully understood the struggles of opioid addiction."
922,"WASHINGTON—As towers of black smoke billowed up across the charred strip of land, sources confirmed Monday that the entire southern border was somehow on fire just 10 minutes after Jared Kushner began tackling the U.S. immigration system. “Just moments after Kushner made his first phone call to the head of ICE, we began receiving reports of 40-foot tall flames spontaneously combusting across the U.S.–Mexico border,” said acting Department of Homeland Security secretary Kevin McAleenan, noting the entirety of the nearly 2,000-mile boundary was burning and that attempts to extinguish the raging inferno only seemed to make the blaze grow more powerful. “We’ve asked Mr. Kushner to please stop emailing us for the time being because every time he hits the send button, a border patrol checkpoint explodes, which is obviously not ideal. We’re confident, however, that if we can figure out how to better control the wall of fire, it may prove an inexpensive way to control undocumented entry into the country.” At press time, a deep fissure had begun swallowing homes along the Canadian border following Kushner’s tour of a detainment camp for immigrant children."
923,"YOUNGSTOWN, OH—Laying out his vision for 2020, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) told supporters Monday that with no chance of securing his party’s nomination for the presidency, he would instead settle for absolutely demolishing the campaign of his fellow Democrat John Hickenlooper. “Let’s face it, I’m probably not going to win a single delegate in this race, but I can still go door to door in Iowa telling people that John Hickenlooper represents everything that is wrong with America,” said Ryan, who explained that upon reviewing his poll numbers, he decided to invest nearly all of his campaign funds in opposition research and attack ads aimed at taking down the Colorado governor. “I’m gonna come out swinging at that fucker and hit him with everything I’ve got. Has he had an affair? Has he taken big donations from Wall Street? I have no idea, but I’m gonna try pinning that and much worse on him just to see if it sticks. Mark my words, I am in this race to beat John Hickenlooper, and I’m staying in it until the day he withdraws.” Ryan went on to pledge that if the two of them ever made it to the debate stage, he would devote his entire time to interrupting every word Hickenlooper speaks."
924,"WASHINGTON—Bursting through the Congressional chamber doors while moaning and clutching his shoulder, John Bolton reportedly stumbled into the Capitol building Friday claiming that he’d been shot by Iran. “Help, help, I’ve just been attacked by a large Middle Eastern country around 636,000 square miles in size,” said the national security advisor, telling those assembled that he’d just been minding his own business when an aggressive Islamic Republic had thrown him on the ground and shot him with a long-range missile. “Right after Iran shot me, I heard the nation laugh and say ‘Somebody stop me before I go on a homicidal rampage.’ It was acting crazed and irrational, and I could smell enriched uranium coming from one of its urban centers. Please, hurry, if we move quickly, we might still be able to catch it before it’s too late.” Upon further questioning, Bolton admitted that the incident had happened so fast that it was possible he’d been attacked by Venezuela or North Korea."
925,"BURLINGAME, CA—Stressing that he is a “two-term United States senator for Christ’s sake,” White House Democratic hopeful Mike Gravel told reporters Wednesday that he can’t believe he’s polling neck-and-neck with a fucking nobody like Florida mayor Wayne Messam. “That Messam prick’s been in politics for, what, a few years? I was a legislator in nineteen-fucking-sixty-three. I should be in with the big dogs like Bernie or Liz Warren, not slumming it in the pissant 20,000-donors club,” said the 88-year-old prospective candidate, who added that “you would think a name like Mike goddamn Gravel would carry a little more weight than a mayor of some podunk town in godforsaken Florida.” “I’m the son of a bitch who read the Pentagon Papers into Congressional Record. Now, I’m competing to qualify for debates with this no-name Messam asshole, not to mention that hippy-dippy bullshit author Marianne Whatever-The-Hell-Her-Name-Is [Williamson]. I’m not even polling at 1% yet. Is it me or is there something really fucked with that picture? Wayne Messam, my ass.” At press time, Messam had pulled ahead of Gravel in the polls."
926,"WASHINGTON—Saying his outbursts have hindered their ability to hold constructive military strategy sessions, top Pentagon aides have repeatedly asked National Security Advisor John Bolton to stop setting fire to their Middle East tactical map, sources confirmed Wednesday. “We keep trying to lay out troop deployment options for Mr. Bolton, but it’s difficult when he just barges in, pours lighter fluid all over the map, and flicks a lit match on top,” said Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, who acknowledged this was hardly the first time Bolton had destroyed a tabletop display of the region while screaming, “Burn, motherfuckers, burn!” “He’s the one who requested a more robust military plan, but it’s hard to brief him when you’re looking at a bunch of melted blotches and you can’t tell what’s Syria and what’s Iran. He even burned up the components on the map representing our own troops. Honestly, it’s hard enough getting through meetings with a guy who stops up his ears and screams anytime the word ‘Iraq’ is mentioned.” At press time, President Trump had reportedly viewed the remnants of the map and signed off on Bolton’s plan."
927,"WASHINGTON—As the inconsolable president stood outside in his threadbare robe in the early hours of Wednesday morning, employees sent by Deutsche Bank began removing possessions from the White House after Donald Trump defaulted on his loans, sources confirmed. “Come on, guys, just give me a couple more weeks and I can get the money together—no, not the TV!” said the tear-stricken commander in chief as repossession officers from the German bank carried items including the Resolute Desk, a portrait of Andrew Jackson, and his golf clubs out of the White House, informing him that the bank could no longer wait for him to pay back millions of dollars of debt. “Not the china, that was Reagan’s! Please, you guys know I’m good for it. I have the funds, you have to believe me, I’ve got them tied up in other things. I just have to move some money around. Wait, that’s my favorite chair! If my wife gets home and sees that her beautiful clothes and the Winston Churchill bust are gone, she’s gonna kill me! I’ll get the money—please don’t leave me with nothing.” At press time, the sobbing president was standing barefoot in the empty Oval Office after the Deutsche Bank employees had removed the slippers from his feet."
928,"WASHINGTON—Amidst escalating Chinese tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports, President Donald Trump sought to reassure struggling American farmers Tuesday by stating that he has never seen one of them and cannot be sure they actually exist. “While rumors of flooding and economic strife circulate, rest assured that I have never seen a guy in baggy overalls riding a tractor and must therefore conclude you are probably not real,” said the president, who attempted to soothe the fears of the approximately 3.2 million farmers in the United States by explaining that as far as he knows, they are some kind of folktale or legend. “I know there are agricultural CEOs. I know there are chickens, because I’ve eaten those. But if you’re, say, a soybean grower who’s hurting financially right now because I started a trade war with China, please understand that I don’t see or hear you and will never see or hear you.” At press time, Trump was reportedly struggling to remember why he had just been talking about chicken."
929,"NEW YORK—Blanketing airwaves, print, radio, and social media with dire warnings of incurring public humiliation, the De Blasio Political Action Committee spent $30 million on advertisements urging the mayor of New York City, Bill de Blasio, to not embarrass himself by running for president, sources confirmed Thursday. “As friends and admirers of Mayor de Blasio, we want to do everything in our power to make sure he doesn’t make a total jackass of himself by running for president,” said PAC president Greg Zimmer, highlighting the mail flyers distributed directly to de Blasio’s house cautioning him not to run because of how it would affect his family, a TV commercial push with 3-minute spots during the mayor’s favorite programs reminding him that there are already 20 other Democratic candidates with better ideas and more support, and a social media video blitz featuring elected officials and donors referencing polling data that shows him at 0%. “We’ve also launched a massive billboard campaign with slogans like “Jesus, Please Don’t Do This,” “Come To Your Senses, Bill,” and “No One Wants This.” Once that’s up, our team of canvassers will knock on his door every 20 minutes to personally beg him not to do this by reminding him that he’s already got a great gig as the mayor of New York City. We hope our message will resonate with him.” At press time, sources confirmed the De Blasio PAC had hired a number of “consultants” to knock some sense into de Blasio."
930,"ATLANTA—Describing the law as a “common-sense measure” designed to protect reproductive health, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia signed a bill Tuesday that strictly prohibits all abortions except during a single 30-second window on the third day of the fourth week of pregnancy. “To be clear, this statute does not outlaw abortion per se, it merely designates a half-minute timeframe during which a woman must fill out all necessary paperwork, view a sonogram of her embryo, provide evidence of the dates of her last period, and complete the procedure terminating her pregnancy,” said a spokesperson for Kemp, stressing that no exceptions could be made for women whose 30-second window falls outside the hours of the state’s sole prenatal ultrasound tech, who works Monday to Wednesday, midnight to 6 a.m., in an unmarked building 80 miles north of Atlanta. “This law provides for the licensing of one abortion clinic, which, upon its completion in 2029, will operate in an undisclosed location in the state’s southeastern quadrant. This state-of-the-art medical facility will be staffed by highly trained law enforcement officials who will be on hand to arrest anyone who spends more than her 30 seconds under the care of a physician, at which point she will be charged with attempted murder.” Kemp later signed a second bill requiring any woman seeking an abortion to undergo two years of state-mandated counseling before the procedure is carried out."
931,"WASHINGTON—Unveiling sweeping policy positions that would transform the nation’s electric grid and combat emissions, Democratic presidential candidate Jay Inslee smashed through the wall of a town hall Wednesday in a solar-powered mech suit to announce his climate change plan. “Starting today, I am dedicating myself to a comprehensive three-part plan designed to head off a climate catastrophe using renewable energy sources, which, as you can see, provide more than enough power for daily needs,” said Governor Inslee from the cockpit of his bipedal, carbon-neutral exoskeleton, touting the potential of clean energy to screaming, debris-covered audience members while extending one of his solar panel-covered hydraulic arms to lift the town hall’s moderator above his head and crush his skull into dust. “We will invest in every power source from wind to biofuels. Even nuclear power will be necessary for some purposes, as you’ll see from the fusion-powered lasers issuing from this suit. But know this: We will not let the next generation down!” At press time, Inslee was spotted blasting a Baltimore coal plant with his hydrogen-based shoulder cannon while discussing the need to transition America to a clean fuel economy."
932,"The filibuster, a practice in which members of Congress can purposely delay a proposal through a lengthy speech or debate, is a source of controversy among both political parties.The Oniontakes a look at the history of the filibuster. Philip Schuyler becomes first member of Senate to ramble on a little too long about something no one else cares about. Aaron Burr helps cement the filibuster into Senate law, keeping in mind that any good democracy is built on loopholes. A group of Whig senators stage the first successful filibuster in a stroke of legislative genius that explains why the party is still such a dominant force in politics today. President Woodrow Wilson urges change to the filibuster on the grounds that it’s super annoying when you really want to drive the U.S. into a war but a coequal branch of government won’t let you. Jimmy Stewart’s iconic filibuster inMr. Smith Goes To Washingtoninspires countless future politicians to misconstrue own passionate causes as heroic. A tearful Wayne Morse abruptly stops his 22-hour filibuster of the Submerged Lands Act after realizing what he’s really speaking out against is his strained relationship with his father. Strom Thurmond ends 24-hour, 18-minute filibuster against the Civil Rights Act after finally getting word in over the applause. Rand Paul figures this the most effective way for him to grab some easy headlines. Mitch McConnell’s nine-hour filibuster to defeat 19th consecutive Democrat-sponsored bill to fight climate change only underscores importance of always letting both sides have their say"
933,"WASHINGTON—Insisting that his administration was nothing less than “a well-oiled machine,” President Donald Trump dismissed continued concerns over chaos in the White House Friday after a pack of feral dogs claimed a fourth West Wing room as their territory. “Honestly, this was not a room that we needed anymore—there are many other rooms to meet in, if we want to meet for some reason, so this one has gone over to the dogs, or we let it be taken by dogs, which, you know, that’s okay,” said Trump, fresh blood seeping through the bandages on his hands and face as he reiterated that staff had the situation completely under control and would continue to throw raw meat into the dogs’ rooms each day in order to ensure the pack did not range farther into the executive facilities in search of food. “We are absolutely focused on making America great again, because whether these dogs are in 3 rooms, or even maybe they get up to 6 rooms, or even more rooms, maybe, that doesn’t matter. I’m more concerned about the Democrats, or the obstructionist Democrats, than I am about 40 to 60 dogs roaming the White House. These are mostly medium-sized dogs, many breeds, not large dogs like some are saying. There are greyhounds and German shepherds, and I think labradors. It is hard to tell. But when I got here, there were hundreds of dogs running wild, let in by Obama. Obama’s dogs. What’s left are our dogs and very few of which have rabies, but there are less of them now. The area is restricted, and I have been told that there is very little chance they’ll move into the Oval Office, which is where I often am.” Trump also confirmed that he would soon announce a new pick for Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to replace Ben Carson, who was recently devoured by dogs."
934,"WASHINGTON—Criticizing leaders of the organized labor movement for supporting Democrats and for the treatment of their members, Donald Trump announced Monday that he was resigning from the United President Workers Local 150 in protest of unions. “Today I informed the Washington, D.C. chapter of the UPW that I will no longer be part of a union that doesn’t truly stand up for the material conditions of its workers,” said Trump, ripping up his union card and becoming the first president to quit the union since it was formed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1935. “Unions may have once served the interests of the working-class American presidents who make up its 71 chapters nationwide, but those days are long gone. I appreciate the benefits I’ve received through the UPW, like reduced prescription costs and discount Costco membership. I will also miss my healthcare, but I’m tired of paying exorbitant dues to the fat cats in union leadership. I’ve been a proud member of the UPW for years; however, it’s clear that workers stand to benefit more without union bureaucrats getting in the way.” At press time, former presidents and UPW members Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Jimmy Carter had released a joint statement urging the nation not to work with any president who’s a scab."
935,"BURLINGTON, VT—Expressing their utter disgust and disappointment over the candidate’s remarks, supporters of presidential contender Bernie Sanders went on the attack Thursday, laying into the Vermont senator for his criticism of mistakes made by the 2016 Bernie Sanders campaign. “These deeply misguided comments make it crystal clear that Sanders just doesn’t understand what the Sanders campaign was all about,” said Sanders loyalist and 2016 campaign volunteer Greg Birch, one of the legions of supporters who took to Twitter and Facebook to condemn Sanders as a “centrist phony” and question his motivations for challenging the methods favored by their candidate of choice, Bernie Sanders. “How dare Bernie say that Bernie didn’t do enough to reach women and African American voters? He clearly doesn’t know the first thing about what Bernie stands for. But if he wants to obsess over the past and quibble about semantics, so be it. We’ll be over here with Bernie Sanders starting a revolution.” Numerous voters describing themselves as fervent Sanders supporters told reporters there was no reason to listen to anything else Sanders might have to say, as he was “pretty much a Clinton shill at this point.”"
936,"AMES, IA—Attempting to redirect the conversation to a more neutral topic that would prevent anyone from getting too worked up, a diplomatic Pete Buttigieg quickly changed the subject Wednesday when politics came up at a town hall event. “Hey, I get asked about political stuff all the time—let’s find something else to talk about,” said the presidential candidate, who later responded to an audience question about climate change by asking if anyone in attendance had a good Instant Pot recipe they would like to share. “We don’t want to get onto topics like immigration and student debt and get all bogged down in policy minutiae. What have you guys been watching on Netflix lately? Let’s just keep it light and get to know each other.” Buttigieg reportedly went on to spend much of the event soliciting details from the crowd about what kinds of fun things they have planned for the summer."
937,"GOFFSTOWN, NH—Erupting into frenzied applause as the Democratic presidential candidate began mercilessly choking the CNN town hall moderator with a single hand, a televised audience gave Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) a standing ovation Monday night as she lifted Chris Cuomo into the air by his throat. “Her performance was generally unexceptional until the moment she violently turned on Chris and starting crushing his windpipe in her remarkably powerful grip,” said CNN analyst Emily Breckmeyer, noting that Klobuchar had successfully tapped into the crowd’s desire to see a red-faced Chris Cuomo struggling for air as his eyes rolled back into his head and his feet jerked and flailed below him. “This is the most enthusiastic reception we’ve seen from a candidate town hall thus far in the 2020 race. After Sen. Klobuchar slammed Chris over her knee and shattered his back, nearly every single audience member started chanting, ‘Finish him! Finish him!’ in perfect unison. It’s still early, but I wouldn’t be surprised if this is remembered as a defining moment of her campaign.” A poll released Tuesday morning found that the majority of American television viewers would like to see Klobuchar’s next town hall appearance hosted by MSNBC’s Chris Matthews."
938,"SOUTH BEND, IN—Becoming the first 2020 presidential candidate to disclose his fondness for pepperoni pizza, jogging before sunrise, and episodes ofThe Wire, White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg released Tuesday a comprehensive list of fun personality quirks for reporters to include in articles about him. “I want to be completely transparent with the American people about all of my most relatable idiosyncrasies, including how much I love Thursdays, the music of Fleetwood Mac, waterskiing, and the gentle sound of rain in the springtime,” read the nine-page press release, which was sent out to thousands of media organizations and also states that the South Bend mayor is a helpless romantic, chooses “We Didn’t Start The Fire” when he sings karaoke, and was a voracious reader as a kid. “Before casting a ballot in the Democratic primaries, voters deserve an opportunity to see Instagram posts of my dogs, a video of my husband surprising me on my birthday, and the results of a Buzzfeed quiz I took revealing which Disney villain I would be. I’m providing not only a concrete description of the chicken pot pie recipe I use and what position I sleep in, but also amusing anecdotes from my semester abroad in Spain, photos of the cute face I make when I’m deep in thought, and a ranked list of all the Harry Potter books, from my favorite to my least favorite. Unlike my fellow candidates, I believe the public deserves to know what I called my maternal grandmother (Gran!) when I was growing up.” At press time, sources confirmed rival candidate Beto O’Rourke had followed Buttigieg’s lead by immediately releasing a list of which hardcore bands he thinks are cool and which skateboard tricks he can still do."
939,"It has been nearly 82 years since marijuana was first officially banned as an illicit substance in the United States. Over that time, we have seen incredible changes across our nation. We have survived a world war and the Cold War, seen the sexual revolution and legalization of abortion, impeached a president, and suffered the rise of reality TV. But somehow, marijuana remains taboo as thousands are unjustly imprisoned through an ill-advised and ill-fated war on drugs. After decades of such folly, the choice is clear: We must legalize marijuana as the next step on our path to the breakdown of all laws and societal norms. If we someday want to live in a world where heroin, sex trafficking, and murder are all permitted, we need to start by legalizing pot. For years, critics have warned that marijuana is a slippery slope to more dangerous drugs and activities—they are correct, and that is exactly why it should be legalized. Ending the prohibition on cannabis will send a clear message that we are a society on the verge of collapse, and hopefully inspire the citizens of this nation to make the final push over the edge. The Onion’s editorial board dreams of a day when stabbing someone in the spinal column and eating them in the street is perfectly legal. We’ve been fighting since day one against restrictions on human freedom, and a world in which marijuana is legal is a world not far from legalizing assault or bestiality. We will break the stifling bonds of human morality once and for all. Ever since our auspicious founder Friedrich Siegfried Zweibel fled the Prussian government’s attempts to prosecute him for “selling potatoes black with rot and herring of a most foul composition” and crossed the Atlantic to find freedom in America, we have stood against the tyranny of government control. America’s Finest News Source was at the forefront of the fight against prohibition and authoritarian workplace safety laws. We have worked tirelessly to dismantle all the corrupt institutions that seek to impose limits on human behavior. Thousands in America are unjustly imprisoned on marijuana-related offenses, and millions more are unjustly imprisoned for theft, arms smuggling, and vehicular homicide. This is a crime against nature. No man’s hands should be bound, none of his thirsts should remain unquenched, no child should remain unemployed. Some have criticized the marijuana legalization process as too slow, decrying incrementalism in place of a full-fledged leap into anarchy. While there is merit in the desire to maim and burn and copulate in the streets as soon as possible, we feel this is unrealistic. Man is a timid beast at times, and The Onion knows we must hold it by the hand and lead it toward enlightenment. Legalizing pot is the smartest first step toward a utopian nation where an insult can be met with a knife to the throat, where a man can hunt drugged humans while feasting on the meat of the rarest endangered animals. Once society tolerates the open smoking of joints, it will only be a matter of time before humans can see no difference between right and wrong, and 5,000 years of human folly will finally start to fall away. The full-scale collapse of civilization may be outside the desires of dull, unimaginative cowards who only want to sit on their couches, watching mindless TV and living free from roaming gangs of organ harvesters, but they don’t see the future. The Onion welcomes it with open arms. We live in a world in which the cowardice of morals and the desire for stability chain our minds. We are supposed to care for each other, respect each other, go to work, but all that will be rendered meaningless with cannabis. Society is a lie. Death and destruction are the only rules of nature, and the prohibition of marijuana infringes on that. Soon, not only weed, but also crack and amphetamines will flow freely, and mothers will bash their children’s skulls in to partake in drug-fueled orgies uninhibited by society’s standards. These are things we all secretly desire, the dark heart of man we try to deny with our rules and regulations. But The Onion knows the truth: We were born to eat each other. A man should be free to smoke a joint with one hand and sip wine from the skull of his enemy in another. From the moment man harnessed the power of fire, he became an agent of destruction—now the embers of our blunts and bowls will seal our fate. We have always tried to fight disorder, but that is the disorder itself. Is a man who cannot shoot heroin and expose himself in public truly free? No. That is why the editors of The Onion endorse legalization. We must be saved from ourselves, and only by embracing the darkness and ending the prohibition of marijuana can we do it."

Here are the biggest revelations from the Mueller report. The president has lied on at least one occasion. George Papadopoulos’ handwriting sucks. Trump was angry and fearful, just like any normal person about to be completely cleared of obstruction. Mueller didn’t subpoena Trump for testimony because his lies under oath wouldn’t add any new information to the investigation. Hundreds of references to a mysterious individual known as “Harmful To Ongoing Matters.” Confirmation of rumors that America’s legal system not very good. Mueller repeatedly recommended James Comey be arrested for treason. Clearly discloses identity of Q, if you’re smart enough to follow the clues.

When I open my mouth, they just start pouring out of me automatically,” said a combative Huckabee Sanders, contending that she cannot be held responsible for the eerie, guttural rumbling that originates in her gut and slowly works its way up to her mouth, resulting in a disturbing oratory operating outside of her conscious awareness. “It’s detestable that the press would pin the words that come out of my mouth on me. Don’t you dare question my motives by blaming me for this mysterious force using my voice to communicate with the media. Is it a demon? A machine?

All I know is that when I open my mouth, the world goes dark and then I’ll come to later with no memory whatsoever of what just happened.

The populist chief strategist was ousted from the White House when it became increasingly clear that his views on turning the U.S. into an ethnostate weren’t strong enough. Trump’s vocal support of white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville upset the former chief economic advisor so much that he resigned the very next eight months later. The original first lady returned to her native Slovenia in May 2018. The former deputy press secretary left the administration for the more traditional reason of joining a lobbying firm. Actually, he’s somehow still there. Hey, remember when this guy was one of the most famous people in the world for a little while? Anyway, he resigned, and we’re not sure what he’s doing now.

At the very least, we’re hoping that at some point before we finish reading this thing, we find evidence of Paul Manafort or Don Jr. or someone putting on a life jacket.” At press time, theBoating Worldteam had published its first update, which began with the words “Ahoy, there, readers!”"
945,"WASHINGTON—According to a conclusion reached by expert analysis Thursday, you are far too dumb to be reading Robert Mueller’s report on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election yourself. “To put it bluntly, you are a moron, and as a moron, you lack the basic reading skills that would make looking at this report fruitful in any way,” read the analysis in part, adding that your best option here was to give up on trying to parse over 400 pages of legal text, admit that you are a goddamn idiot, and go back to looking at pictures of dogs or whatever the hell an imbecile like yourself wastes their life doing. “Wait a few days, let the grown-ups examine this, and then give them a chance to tell you what to think in simple infographic form. Until then, you might as well stop trying to sound out words like ‘pursuant,’ close your laptop or turn off your phone, and go to sleep for the rest of the day.” The report concluded that despite your personal and intellectual failings, you should still give yourself a nice little pat on the back for trying."
946,"WASHINGTON—In an attempt to satisfy calls for transparency while also keeping delicate information under wraps, Attorney General William Barr announced Thursday that he had released a catatonic Robert Mueller after excising all sensitive material from the special counsel’s brain. “With the cuts we’ve made to his prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, we can now make Robert Mueller available to both Congress and the American people,” said Barr, who explained that in the four weeks since the special counsel’s investigation ended, the Justice Department had gone to great lengths to capture, confine, and forcibly lobotomize Mueller, ensuring any material deemed unsuitable for the public would remain secret. “In order to keep the details of grand jury testimony and ongoing investigations confidential, we carefully blacked out his memory of the past two years before releasing him. Unfortunately, it would appear this safety precaution has also resulted in Mr. Mueller forgetting how to speak, walk, and feed himself.” At press time, sources confirmed the drooling, glassy-eyed special counsel was set to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, whose members were trying to get him to respond to his name so they could swear him in."

At no point did she even try to correct her mistake by saying the word ‘troops’ or saluting the nearest flag and crying.

952,"Rather than speculate or entertain the lowly media’s wild theories regarding the future of marijuana,The Onion’s editorial board today released a definitive list of events that will, with near perfect certainty, occur when weed is legalized. Should pro-cannabis laws ever be passed on the federal level, America will forever be changed in the following five ways. 1. With legalized weed becoming easily accessible, glaucoma, the only disease keeping modern humanity blind enough to remain in check, will abruptly disappear.After just a few short years, formerly misty-eyed humans will develop so-called “super vision” so crisp, so clear, that the only option will be to ritually gouge out our own eyes to repent for our species’ past hubris. One day, mankind will look back and realize that keeping weed illegal was the only thing stopping us from spiraling out of control. 2. Should marijuana become normalized throughout society, the character “Shorty” from the 2000 filmScary Moviewill no longer be regarded as a hilarious, goofy high school stoner, but as an accurate reflection of ourselves.In fact, in a world where Shorty’s papers, blunts, and bongs are simply commonplace, humanity risks being unable to laugh at even the character’s most climactic scene in which he gets rolled into a bed sheet and smoked by a giant weed monster. 3. Within the next five to 10 years, every child who is born in the United States of America will be federally mandated to have a single blunt surgically implanted into the frontal lobe of their brain.Although the “subdermal spliff” will not technically have any effect on humans whatsoever, each person will be required by law to keep it throughout their entire lives until the day they die, at which point their family will be allowed to remove it and smoke it at their funeral. 4. After spending billions lobbying Congress to loosen marijuana laws, the U.S. army will finally deploy the many long-range spliff missiles, skunky-ass ballistics, and 10-megaton ganja bombs they have been secretly developing for use in war.According to chemical warfare experts, should this technology become readily available, just a single hit from one of these powerful THC-based weapons will have the potential to fuck up entire villages and leave regions baked for decades with the dankest shit the world has ever seen. 5. While the following is hotly debated,The Onionand our veteran team of economists, scientists, and lobbyists firmly believe that once marijuana is legalized, people will begin smoking weed.In as few as 10 years after legalization, reports indicate that Americans might not just consume the drug once, but will also smoke it two or three times, even in places like concerts, parties, and their own homes. To many, however, this simply remains inconceivable. Again, it is important to note that were marijuana to be legalized, the previous five events would happen almost immediately, ripping a hole through the space–time continuum and creating an irreversible vacuum between before and after, from which we could never return. In closing,The Onionrelishes the chance to rise from the wreckage that marijuana legalization will soon inevitably create. When chaos one day reigns down upon us and corporations are asked to step in, lobby Congress, and ultimately seize control of production, distribution, and regulation—we will be ready. Sincerely yours, The OnionEditorial Board"
953,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that he would present the investigation’s findings in a format that offered the most richly detailed portrayal of its full meaning, Attorney General William Barr reportedly agreed Friday to release a nonverbal, abstract visual representation of the Mueller report. “I’m nearly done going through the special counsel’s conclusions and will be ready to deliver them in the form of a multimedia performance featuring interpretative dance, experimental music, and a variety of conceptual art installations within the next week or two,” said Barr, adding that he had already finished summarizing President Trump’s firing of James Comey in a 30-minute postmodern movement piece incorporating aerial silks and a fog machine, and had finally hit upon a suitable way to show Congress the significance of Trump’s contact with former campaign chair Paul Manafort by smearing red, white, and blue paint on the walls of a white space over a collage of slowed-down audio recorded in a slaughterhouse. “It’s clear, given the nature of the special counsel’s findings, that any summary must be issued to Congress with my voice removed, indeed artificially silenced, allowing the canvas of my body to convey the full extent of the report’s subconscious dialogues and liminal fixation on agency and the dialectic of guilt and innocence. Indeed, it is only through repeatedly assembling and disassembling a bricolage of objects such as metal pails, rusty saws, and clumps of wax that I can truly express the hidden and fluctuating tensions expressed in Mueller’s analysis of whether Trump pressured Jeff Sessions to conform to his wishes. The American people deserve to see a full performance of me lying nude and motionless on a concrete slab under a Cubist portrait of Mueller as masked, mute figures representing Donald Jr., Michael Flynn, and Michael Cohen slowly walk in circles, tearing pieces of paper and scattering them over me, every so often extemporaneously interrupting the sounds of kettle drum and lagerphone by erupting in a primal scream. Only then can Americans fully understand the truth.” Barr also clarified that in order to protect classified government intelligence, he would have to perform the part of his presentation where he wordlessly beats his chest, smears himself in glitter, and repeatedly turns on and off several televisions behind a curtain where no one can see."
954,"WASHINGTON—Peering into the darkened sky as 200-mph winds began to whip around them, several eyewitnesses confirmed Thursday that a lightning bolt blasted off the top of the Washington Monument while Mike Pence and Pete Buttigieg were locked in a battle of prayers on the National Mall. According to onlookers, the current vice president and mayor of South Bend, INcould be seen kneeling on the ground with their hands folded, deep in prayer, at which point Mike Pence whispered that “Mr. Buttigieg knows better than to question my faith,” causing the sky to turn black, the water in the Reflecting Pool to part, and the two men to slowly levitate several feet above the ground. As the temperature dropped and the earth burst open below them, witnesses confirmed that Buttigieg’s eyes turned red, and the presidential candidate shouted, “If you have a problem with me, you have a problem with my maker,” immediately flinging Mr. Pencebackwardsinto the Vietnam War Memorial with an eruption of psychic energy. At press time, Pence and Buttigieg reportedly fused into a single, blindingly white light as countless angels swirled around them from the heavens, only to plummet back to the ground below and lay unconscious while the sky opened up, birds began to chirp, and daylight returned to normal."
955,"WASHINGTON—Saying they are now convinced the candidate is overwhelmingly qualified to lead the country, a majority of Americans have shifted their support to Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the 2020 presidential race since learning he is a millionaire, a Pew Research Center poll found Wednesday. “I have my reservations about his policies, but if the guy’s a millionaire, he must know what he’s doing,” said Cleveland-area voter Glenn Mannix, 48, echoing the sentiments of 68% of the voting populace, who were reportedly impressed upon discovering the royalties Sanders has earned on sales of his books has pushed his net worth to seven figures. “Anyone who’s smart enough to make a million dollars has got to have some pretty great ideas about how to move our country in the right direction. You don’t get to be that rich and successful without having a really good head on your shoulders. The man has my vote!” According to the poll, the remaining 32% of voters agree with all of Sanders’ policies, but said they cannot bring themselves to cast their ballot for someone who owns three homes."
956,"WASHINGTON—Expressing relief that the Republican can finally channel his long-held bigotry into wide-reaching legislative action, family of Texas congressman Louie Gohmert told reporters Wednesday they were glad he finally found an outlet for his racism. “It’s always hard to see someone you love wander aimlessly, which is why we were all so relieved when our Lou found a nice little community of white men his age in the U.S. House of Representatives who believe in their genetic superiority just like him,” said wife Kathy Gohmert, adding that she’s proud her three children could see their father deal with all his prejudices in a healthy way by putting those beliefs into fear-mongering and policymaking. “All his potential was going to waste, so it was a real joy for us when it finally contributed to something real, like using yesterday’s hearings to discredit the legitimate, well-documented threat of white nationalism. It was a long journey to get here, but ever since the Birther movement, his conspiracy theories about Middle East terror babies, and the paranoia he spread about the Muslim Brotherhood, he’s just been so, so much happier.” Family members added that they haven’t seen Gohmert this happy since he was threatening the well-being of minorities as a state district judge."
957,"WASHINGTON—Following the announcement that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was leaving her post, President Trump told reporters Monday he would conduct an extensive search to find a replacement with the right personality disorders necessary for the role. “Though I admired Kirstjen’s ability to remain cold and detached when questioned about the decision to tear apart families at the border, we require someone with an even greater lack of empathy to do this job properly,” said the president, who praised Nielsen for putting children in cages but explained that the ideal candidate for the position must possess a degree of psychopathy so severe that they believe no law or moral code of any kind applies to them. “The next person to head the department must be blessed with strong narcissistic tendencies, of course, but also a consistent record of profoundly antisocial behavior. We need someone both spiteful and cruel, but also willing to totally disregard right and wrong. Basically, the new secretary will need to have a psychological makeup that allows them to look people in the eye and tell them, without hesitation, that we don’t want any non-Americans entering the United States unless they’re coming from one of a very limited group of countries in northern Europe.” At press time, a team of psychiatrists had reportedly presented the president with a stack of résumés that consisted solely of individuals housed in supermax prisons and White House senior adviser Stephen Miller."
958,"WASHINGTON—Arguing that the special counsel’s findings constitute a grave threat to public health, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders told reporters Thursday the Mueller report must never be released because it’s so exonerating it would drive the American people to madness. “This report has found the president so overwhelmingly innocent that the average human mind, unable to grasp just how completely free from culpability he is, would lose its grip on reality and spiral into insanity,” said Huckabee-Sanders, who warned that the general public, upon reading the 300-page report, would be reduced to “gibbering idiots,” foaming at the mouth as they read the secret revelations that confirm President Trump is the single least-guilty individual in the history of mankind. “If everyday citizens were to see for themselves how thoroughly the president has been absolved from any conceivable wrongdoing, they would have a total psychotic breakdown, perhaps gouging their eyes out or stripping naked and running into oncoming traffic. Maybe Democrats don’t care if crazed readers of the full report start cannibalizing their own family members, but in the interests of public safety, we cannot release these pages.” Huckabee-Sanders later added that a raving, feral Attorney General William Barr had recently been fitted with a straightjacket and confined to a secure psychiatric facility."
959,"WASHINGTON—Wondering if he had missed an important memo, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reportedly appeared confused Tuesday as he asked, “What’s all this I’m hearing about people getting security clearances?” to a group of advisers in the West Wing trying to avoid eye contact. “I heard someone down the hall talking about badges of some kind—am I supposed to have one too?” the nation’s top diplomat said while straining to peek over White House innovation director Jared Kushner’s shoulder to read the confidential documents in his hand. “Does everyone have one of those lanyards except me? You guys would tell me if I should have gotten one, right? Maybe mine is still on its way. In the meantime, could you maybe just fill me in on any important stuff that happens? That’d be awesome.” At press time, sources confirmed Pompeo was standing outside the Situation Room and had decided it was probably best to just press his ear up to the door until someone realized he was missing from the meeting and came to let him in."
960,"DAVENPORT, IA—Asserting he could fund his campaign just fine no matter how small the contributions were, increasingly cocky presidential candidate Bernie Sanders announced Tuesday he would no longer be accepting any donations in excess of 27 cents. “Maybe some of my opponents are comfortable courting big donors who will give them 15, even 20 bucks, but as long as I’m in this race, anyone who hands me a dollar bill will immediately be handed 73 cents in change,” said the Vermont senator, who during a rally at a municipal auditorium expressed complete confidence that he could fund his organization all the way through the 2020 general election with nothing but the loose change in his supporters’ pockets. “Right now, if you have a quarter and a nickel in the ashtray of your car out in the parking lot, give that to me, and I’ll give you three pennies back. That’s all I need to put the people back in charge of this country. But if you have any big glass jars full of change, save those for the Coinstar machine, because the presidency of the United States should never be for sale.” An hour after finishing his speech, Sanders was spotted hanging around in the lobby and helping people break tens and twenties so they could use a nearby soda machine."
961,"WASHINGTON—Irked that the attorney general’s brief summary of his meticulously written report reflected only a surface-level understanding of its contents, Special Counsel Robert Mueller told reporters Monday he was peeved that William Barr clearly didn’t read his stuff like he suggested he would. “I worked really hard on this thing for two years, put some great stuff in there, and as far as I can tell he just glanced over it briefly and tossed it aside,” said Mueller, who expressed irritation that Barr, despite assuring the former FBI director that he couldn’t wait to read his new work, had apparently not bothered to absorb the nuanced, comprehensive 300-page report before writing a cursory, four-page letter about it. “I mean, there was some pretty hard-hitting material in there—did he miss that completely? Either he skimmed through it really fast or he handed it off to an assistant without reading it all. Seriously, I put my heart and soul into those pages, and the best he can muster in a superficial response that almost entirely misses the point? What the hell?” At press time, Mueller was reportedly worried that maybe Barr flat-out hated his work and had offered the vague, bare-bones summary in order to spare the special counsel’s feelings."
962,"WASHINGTON—Insisting that they had taken every measure to keep the message “extra top secret,” the Trump boys reportedly spent Wednesday defending their decision to send Saudi Arabia plans for a cool missile using their personal Etch A Sketch. “We spent, like, a million hours making that rocket look super good, so we had to send it to our friends in Sunny Arabia [sic] as soon as we could,” said Eric Trump of the jagged rendering of an airborne missile with what appeared to be a lightning bolt on its side, noting that they had done everything they could to ensure the privacy of the plans, which included labeled stick-figures of both brothers as well as a dog that they hoped their dad would buy for them. “No one even gave us a government Etch A Sketch. Besides, there’s this awesome ninja in there that would have been way too hard to redo. Plus, we made sure the prince knew to shake it up when he was done, just so it’s all super safe.” At press time, the Trump boys were denying responsibility for the recent leak of Lite-Brite plans for a new baby brother."
963,"MOSCOW—Saying that he had been “totally blindsided” by the revelations from the recently released findings of the Mueller investigation, a shocked Vladimir Putin reportedly came to the realization Tuesday that he didn’t conspire with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign after all. “What the hell? I worked so hard on this—if I wasn’t colluding with the Trump campaign, who the hell was I colluding with?” said the dumbfounded Russian president, growing increasingly angry as he scrolled through his email inbox and recounted his numerous efforts at covert communication with individuals who he had thought were high-ranking Trump officials, but now he suspected were bots or anonymous internet trolls. “Man, it seemed so legit. I can’t believe I let myself get conned like this. I spent so much time emailing back and forth with DonaldTrump46@hotmail.com about compromising the democratic voting process, and now it turns out it was all fake? And we spent so much time gathering all that kompromat on the wrong people. Goddammit, I feel like I’ve wasted my life.” At press time, Putin was frantically double-checking that Russia had assisted in propping up a dictator in Syria and not some other country."
964,"WASHINGTON—Exercising his powers of clemency for the first time since taking office, President Trump compassionately issued a full presidential pardon Monday for former Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller that cleared him of any wrongdoing. “Today, under my authority as president of the United States, I hereby grant a full and unconditional pardon to Robert Mueller, a man who has spent the past two years being slandered for misdeeds that he never even committed,” said Trump, stressing that though Mueller had his share of missteps, recently released evidence now proved that the special counsel’s heart has always been in the right place. “This poor guy has been through Hell and back. He’s had dirt thrown on his name and been unfairly attacked on social media, and for what? He’s a good, honorable man. So today I’m saying: Bob, go home to your family. You’ve earned it.” At press time, Trump was even more disturbed to realize that if one thing had turned out differently, an innocent man like Mueller could have only been a single day away from spending the rest of his life in prison."
965,"WASHINGTON—Following the completion of the special counsel’s 22-month probe, Attorney General William P. Barr declared Monday that Robert Mueller’s investigation fully exonerates all members of Ronald Reagan’s presidential administration from involvement in the Iran–Contra affair. “I’ve reviewed Mr. Mueller’s findings and have determined conclusively that neither the late president nor any White House or Cabinet official serving between 1981 and 1989 ever ordered, oversaw, or even knew about the covert sales of American arms to Iran,” Barr said in a letter to the House and Senate judiciary committees, clearing key figures such as retired National Security Adviser John Poindexter and former staffer Oliver North in a move that finally lifts what many have seen as a dark cloud over the scandal-plagued presidency. “I assessed this report carefully and can at long last say with full certainty that Caspar Weinberger, Robert McFarlane, Elliott Abrams, and all others in the president’s inner circle operated lawfully from the time of the initial dealings in 1981 until the illegal arrangement was exposed five years later. From the 1985 diversion of funds to Contra rebels in Nicaragua, to Reagan’s untruthful 1986 denial of an arms-for-hostage trade, to the flagrant destruction of countless documents relevant to the investigation, everyone acted properly and with the best interests of the United States in mind. It is my hope that the country can now move forward and put this unfortunate episode behind it.” At press time, sources reported that Democratic leaders in Congress were still discussing a possible push for President Reagan’s impeachment."
966,"WASHINGTON—Doubling down on his criticism of the departed lawmaker in the face of bipartisan condemnation, President Trump ramped up his attacks Thursday against the late John McCain by exhuming the senator’s corpse and dragging it behind his presidential motorcade. “I’m having some trouble understanding the strategy behind unearthing the body of this true American hero, chaining it to the bumper of a limousine, and driving it around our nation’s capital,” said Sen. Mitt Romney (R-UT), who added that shackling McCain’s half-decomposed remains by the neck to the presidential state car and speeding through D.C.’s most pothole-ridden streets would only serve to distract people from Trump’s important policy initiatives. “It’s not only counterproductive, but an insult to John McCain’s memory to see his lifeless body bouncing and flailing across the National Mall like that. It certainly wasn’t necessary for them to exceed 55 miles on the Beltway. I’d really prefer if the president refrained from such conduct.” At press time, sources confirmed Trump had further escalated his attacks against the late senator by off-roading with the corpse through the rugged terrain of Rock Creek Park."
967,"WASHINGTON—Vowing to fight tooth and nail against what he called “an insidious smear campaign,” Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA) announced Wednesday he was considering filing a defamation lawsuit against his official Twitter account for ruining his reputation. “The figure behind @DevinNunes has disparaged my good name in what appears to be a highly coordinated effort to make me look like some kind of whiny, impetuous idiot,” said the House Intelligence Committee’s ranking member, who accused the verified account of repeatedly posting and sharing content that has portrayed him as “a crackpot with abhorrent views” since the profile was first created in 2009. “The fact that Twitter has allowed this account to exist for nearly a decade is a major testament to the platform’s left-leaning bias. They’ve stood idly by and watched while my official account has spewed out nothing but drivel and lies. This is character assassination, pure and simple.” Nunes added that hopefully the lawsuit would serve as a stern warning to other outlets that have smeared him, including his official Facebook account, his official campaign website, and Nunes.house.gov."
968,"WASHINGTON—Saying it was time to “get out the hog for one last ride,” former Vice President Joe Biden pulled the dusty painter’s tarp off of his old campaign motorcycle Wednesday, gently running his hand along the polished chrome headlight and muttering “welcome back, baby.” The vehicle, a 1979 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide with flame decals on both the front and rear fenders, had reportedly been sitting at the back of his garage since the last time he “tore ass” around the capitol in 2012. Sources confirmed that after checking to see if the horn still worked, Biden grabbed a red chamois cloth from his back pocket, spit into it, and begin buffing the bike’s custom “Diamond Joe” gas tank. “The Cherry Chariot rides again,” said Biden, patting the sheepskin seat and releasing a small cloud of dust that was visible in the shop light above his 1980 Christy Brinkley Sports Illustrated poster. “Still a looker that can turn every damn head on the block.” “What do you say we get you out of this cooped-up pen and go for a little spin?” Biden added while inspecting the muffler, a part he briefly removed during his 2007 primary bid to “let her rip loud as hell” at the Iowa State Fair. “You and I have a lot of catching up to do.” Biden, who claimed that the bike could use a new paint job, said that with Bernie Sanders pulling his same old “commie shit” and Elizabeth Warren “totally tanking” in the polls, there was an opening for a Democrat who could ride in on 900 pounds of all-American steel and speak to the middle class. Biden pointed out the motorcycle’s well-worn tire treads and explained that the touring bike, which he won in a 1981 drag race against Speaker of the House Tip O’Neill had “done Diamond Joe real solid” in his 1988 and 2008 presidential runs. The 76-year-old confirmed that just the sound of the engine tearing down an open straightaway was always enough to draw crowds that wanted to “get an eyeful of the goods.” Biden also noted that the vehicle’s sidecar was the perfect size to hold either a running mate or keg. “I used to take this thing up and down the coast. I even got Pelosi to come with for a little weekend shot up to the Delaware Water Gap,” said the former vice president, who added that some of his best early Senate memories were from that trip, with then-Junior-Representative Pelosi passing him ice-cold tallboys from the passenger saddle. “The bike has a personality all its own. Ask anyone who’s come to any of my town halls over the years. The thing’s a 450-cc white-hot clam magnet.” “You hear that baby purring into third gear, your vote isn’t the only thing Uncle Joe’s gonna get,” continued Biden. According to the former six-term Delaware senator, the motorcycle has been involved in a “ton of dicey scrapes.” Biden confirmed that during his previous presidential runs, the bike’s cam chain snapped “all the fucking time,” including once on the way to a diner in New Hampshire in 1988, forcing him to hitch a ride with a passing truck driver with whom he traveled the state until his campaign manager Gooch could tow it to a shop. “I remember once I totally ate it around Buffalo in spring ’87. Let me tell ya, black ice will fuck you up. That’s how I got this,” said Biden, pulling down his oil-stained jeans to reveal a 4-inch scar above his left hip. “I probably should have gone to the ER, but instead I just dumped a bottle of Jack onto the wound, wrapped it in an old Baja hoodie, hammered the fork back into place, and hauled ass to the next campaign stop.” “Let’s face it, I’m not as young as I used to be,” Biden continued. “It pains me to say, but I’m probably going to pussy out and wear a brain bucket for this rodeo.” At press time, Biden reportedly opened the motorcycle’s studded leather storage bag to show off his official campaign steamroller."
969,"PERRYSBURG, OH—Promising to restore economic vitality and dignity to the struggling Rust Belt municipality, President Trump made a solemn promise Monday to bring back the town of Perrysburg, OH’s shuttered White Castle franchise. “White Castle was the lifeblood of this community, but unfortunately, during a previous presidential administration, it was closed down,” said Trump, describing the hardships faced by local families, many of whom patronized the White Castle for generations but can no longer purchase a 30-slider Crave Case without driving more than two hours round-trip to reach the chain’s Ann Arbor, MI location. “This town was built on jalapeño sliders, onion rings, and mozzarella cheese sticks, but now it’s getting screwed over by foreign companies like Taco Bell and Panda Express. Frankly, it’s a disgrace, and I’m in talks with the regional franchise manager to reopen this restaurant and make sure Ohioans have access to all the best American fast foods. Nobody should be forced to sell their home and uproot their family just to move to a town with a White Castle.” When asked about the danger to fast food jobs posed by automated burger-flipping machines, the president responded that he hasn’t looked into it yet but knows a lot about technology and believes the threat is nonexistent."
970,"EL PASO, TX—Revealing plans to “put his own spin” on beloved stump speeches and talking points, Beto O’Rourke announced Thursday that he was starting a Barack Obama cover campaign. “I’ve always loved Barack’s early stuff from back in ’08, even ’04, and I think diehard fans will go crazy when I cover all his greatest hits,” said the 46-year-old White House hopeful, clarifying that he and his campaign aides had spent several months “just going through Barack’s catalog” to memorize the former president’s platform. “Obama’s style always really resonated with me, and honestly, what’s the point in struggling to come up with something new when you can just give people what they want. I’m going to cover some of Barack’s most well-known campaign speeches, putting my own small twists on prison reform and healthcare—they’ll be way heavier, faster, and louder.” At press time, O’Rourke revealed that he had just finished working on a stripped-down version of “Change We Can Believe In” that went directly into a fiery rendition of “Yes, We Can!”"
971,"SOUTH BEND, IN—Touting the benefits in tourism and business revenue that such a project had already brought to his hometown, 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and South Bend, IN mayor Pete Buttigieg announced Thursday a bold plan for a 2,500-mile intercontinental riverwalk. “At a time when Americans are more divided than ever, what this country needs is a riverwalk that will provide people from all strata of society with continuous strolling, dining, and festival opportunities,” said Buttigieg, gesturing to a watercolor architectural rendering of the Intercontinental Riverwalk that he described as his “core campaign plank,” which would revitalize the country’s heartlands by attracting sorely needed coffee shops, clothing boutiques, and artisanal cocktail bars in riverside locations stretching from coast to coast. “Whether you’re just popping down to check out one of our Nationwide Art Fridays or enjoying a relaxing date night of jazz quartets in Tucson and hyper-local food in Louisville, a riverwalk gives our citizens the chance to appreciate this great nation’s beauty through the unparalleled convenience of bike and pedestrian trails stretching from sea to shining sea. That’s why, if elected, this will be my first act in office.” At press time, the Indiana mayor went on to unveil diplomatic plans to broker a pact between Mexico, Canada, and the United States for a Transnational Farmer’s Market on Saturday afternoons."
972,"WASHINGTON—Following a House of Representatives vote to support statehood for the District of Columbia, sources confirmed Tuesday that the nation’s flag nerds were breathless with anticipation, imagining all the potential configurations of stars and stripes that might result from adding a new state. “For years, students of flag-making such as myself have sketched prototypes for a hypothetical 51-star grid, so right now we’re all on pins and needles thinking we might finally get to see an updated American flag,” said Iowa-based flag dweeb Theodore Dreyfus, adding that the renewed push for D.C. statehood had generated highly contentious debates among the dorks in online vexillology forums over just where on the American flag the prospective 51st star should be placed. “We’re also getting pretty worked up over what a flag for the state of Washington, D.C. might look like. Sure, they could just use the district flag they already have, but there are many other exciting options available to them. They could make a flag that includes their new state seal, a picture of George Washington, or maybe even the year they got their statehood. The mind boggles at the possibilities!” At press time, flag nerds across the country were reportedly engaged in heated exchanges about hoists, cantons, fimbriation, fesses, and five-pointed spur-rowels."
973,"DES MOINES, IA—Offering new insight into the preferences of Democratic voters, a poll released Tuesday byThe Des Moines Registerand CNN found that nearly 60 percent of likely Iowa caucus-goers would support a presidential candidate with the name Bobby Cheeseburger. “As many as 47 percent of those surveyed indicated that they’d vote for somebody called Bobby Cheeseburger in a heartbeat without even needing to know all his policy positions,” said pollster Emily Jones, telling reporters that almost a third of Iowans believed a guy named Bobby Cheeseburger could use his homespun wisdom and commitment to American values to bring real change to Washington. “Over half of respondents said they believe that a Bobby Cheeseburger candidacy would stand a strong chance of defeating Trump in the general election by bridging the gap between centrists and liberals as well as appealing to Republicans, and 40 percent said that, if elected, they believed Bobby Cheeseburger would restore our standing in the international community. This level of excitement so early in the primary is really startling, especially when you consider that voters’ second choice, a candidate named Bonnie Cheeseburger, is only polling at 15 percent.” Jones noted that the poll found there was less than 1 percent support for a candidate named Tommy Broccoli or former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper."
974,"WASHINGTON—Insisting that the technology was far too complex and required significant scientific knowledge to use, President Donald Trump complained Tuesday about the overly complicated controls needed to operate modern-day doors. “Doors these days are way too intricate and confusing for the average person to open or close,” said the president in a Twitter thread, insisting that door technology needed to go back to the old days when doors were simple and easy for everyone to use. “The only Americans who know how to operate these complex doors are MIT engineers and rocket scientists, and regular people can’t go inside or outside anymore. There’s a million things to twist and turn and all these buttons, you push and push on them as hard as you can, and yet still half the time doors don’t even work.” Trump added that the issue of door technology struck a personal chord for him, as many of the people who open doors for him are not very smart and often have trouble doing so."
975,"SAYLORVILLE, IA—Assuring the New York senator the custom has been observed by seven generations of proud Saylorville citizens, several bored Iowans reportedly decided Friday they would try to convince visiting White House hopeful Kirsten Gillibrand that it’s a local tradition to eat live tarantulas. “It would sure mean a lot to us, ma’am, if you were to participate in our time-honored custom of taking at least one really big bite out of a living, breathing spider,” said resident Jonathan Buckley, who along with dozens of onlooking neighbors struggled to keep a straight face as he watched the contender for the Democratic nomination consider sinking her teeth into a large, hairy arachnid they placed on a plate in front of her a few moments earlier. “Every presidential candidate who comes through town does it. Obama did it, Bill Clinton did it. Oh, and they all swallow it, too—so don’t spit it out! This is how we honor our town’s founder, John B. Saylor, who in the harsh winter of 1850 had to eat tarantulas every day just to survive. Make sure you dig into the thorax, there. That’s the juiciest part.” At press time, sources confirmed a wheezing Gillibrand was assuring theSaylorvillecrowd she loved the local delicacy as her head and neck swelled up to twice their usual size."

978,"DENVER—Kicking off his campaign with a promise to order the U.S. military to wipe the sovereign nation off the face of the Earth, presidential candidate John Hickenlooper announced Tuesday his support for using nuclear weapons against Australia just to see if anyone was listening to him. “That’s right—did you hear that? If elected president, I will use our massive thermonuclear arsenal to unrelentingly bombard Australia until it is reduced to a smoking crater,” the former Colorado governor said in a bold effort to gauge whether his candidacy was anywhere close to garnering the kind of media coverage necessary to gain traction in the race for the Democratic nomination. “Let me be perfectly clear: My very first act upon taking the oath of office will be to launch a preemptive and wholly unilateral strike against Australia, employing enough weapons of mass destruction to kill all 25 million of the country’s inhabitants and render the entire continent a toxic, permanently uninhabitable wasteland for thousands of years to come. That’s a promise. Are you all getting this?” Reached for comment, Hickenlooper stated that if his current strategy failed to boost his name recognition in the polls, he would also be willing to endorse government-mandated Bible burnings and legalized pedophilia."

Mark Meadows (R–NC) angrily reminded his colleagues Thursday that he had never once publicly complained about the Capitol’s integrated drinking fountains. “It’s completely outrageous that my fellow members of Congress would slander me with charges of bigotry when I have shared a water fountain with African-Americans for over a decade without ever even batting an eye,” said the Freedom Caucus chair, citing his long history of racial tolerance that included letting black members of Congress use the same entrance into the Capitol building and waiting patiently in line behind them in the cafeteria without demanding to be served first. “Shame on Democrats for launching these false and nakedly political attacks against me when they know full well that I have never called the police on my black colleagues for talking to a white woman, or tried to deprive them of voting in committee. If anything, the real racists are those with the temerity to accuse me of racism.” Meadows added that his sterling record of concern for the betterment of the black community was evident from his history of comments suggesting they go back to Africa."
980,"WASHINGTON—Repeatedly attacking the credibility of President Trump’s former lawyer and asking why the House Oversight Committee should believe anything he says, Rep.Jim Jordan (R-OH) spent the bulk of his allotted time during Michael Cohen’s hearing Thursday demanding that he accept blame for covering up the alleged sexual abuse of wrestlers at Ohio State University. “I am not sure how you expect us to just sit here and trust that you’re actually going to tell the truth about your involvement with the president when you’ve said absolutely nothing about these scandalous abuse allegations—what are you hiding?” said Jordan, interrupting another congressperson’s questioning to call attention to the fact that paperwork Cohen submitted ahead of the hearing contained nothing about knowing that hundreds of OSU wrestlers were abused by a team doctor, including during the period from 1986 to 1994 when Jordan served as an assistant coach. “Who are you to accuse the president of crimes given your shady past and connections to Ohio State? You’re obviously only doing this to distance yourself from this disgraceful cover-up, and the fact that you won’t admit to your role in it completely invalidates any shred of decency you might have. Frankly, sir, you are a disgrace to the Buckeyes.” An irate Jordan also informed Cohen in front of the committee that it was particularly galling to hear that someone would turn around and betray those who had trusted him."
981,"WASHINGTON—After passage of a bill to block President Trump’s use of a national emergency declaration to pay for a border wall, members of the House of Representatives voiced concerns Thursday about executive overreach, arguing that only Congress is allowed to misappropriate federal funds. “Throwing away millions of taxpayer dollars on vanity projects is Congress’s job, not the president’s,” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following the 245-to-182 vote to overturn Trump’s declaration, explaining that Article I of the Constitution clearly invests the legislative branch with the sole authority to mismanage public money. “Abusing the power of the purse is expressly reserved to the House and Senate. So it’s not up to the president to decide when we funnel money from one place to another, diverting it from its intended purpose. Burning through cash—whether we’re inflating the military budget or showering millions in unnecessary spending on our home districts—is an exclusively congressional task.” Pelosi concluded her remarks by praising the Founding Fathers for making the House, which is more directly representative of the people, the place where all bills for flushing money directly down the drain must originate."
982,"WASHINGTON—Deciding it was time to “let the dream die,” Special Counsel Robert Mueller gave up trying to get his report on Russian election interference published Thursday after receiving his 19th literary agent rejection. “There was one agent who claimed he really liked my stuff, but didn’t think he could get any of the publishing houses to bite,” said Mueller, who described his report as a classic tale of deception, greed, and international intrigue exposing the rotten core beneath the superficial veneer of American politics. “I really put my heart and soul into this, so it hurts getting a form rejection letter from someone who obviously didn’t even read it. I used to pin them to the wall for motivation, but now I’m running out of room and that’s just super depressing. I still think the report is really compelling and has a lot of fun twists and turns. I even got a subscription toPublishers Weekly, but now I’m out 500 bucks and have nothing to show for it. I’m sure as hell not going to self-publish an e-book on Amazon. I guess maybe it’s time to just admit defeat.” At press time, Mueller reportedly elected to destroy his original manuscript rather than take an agent’s suggestion to edit the draft down to a 250-page YA investigation."
983,"HANOI, VIETNAM—Tearing up as he described the courage he would have had no choice but to summon had he not been born into a life of luxury, President Trump reportedly took time Tuesday before the North Korea summit in Hanoi to travel south and lay a wreath at the spot where he would have died in the Vietnam War if he weren’t rich. “Today we recognize those who, like myself, would have been forced to make the ultimate sacrifice had they not come from wealthy families who could call in a favor from a doctor friend and get exempted from the draft,” said Trump, speaking for several minutes about the death he would have faced if he had been unable to afford an elite education and, instead of receiving college deferments, had been conscripted to fight in a conflict in which more than 58,000 Americans died. “I would have died bravely with my fellow soldiers right here in this field had I not had a father who could pull some strings and make sure I never had to do anything like that. So today, I reflect upon and honor all those who were able to avoid service, especially those who received a medical deferment from a podiatrist who rented office space from their dad.” Trump went on to announce that a new monument would be erected on the National Mall in Washington to honor all affluent survivors of the Vietnam draft."
984,"WASHINGTON—Demonstrating their findings with a crumpled ball of aluminum foil, a panel of White House–appointed scientists convened for the first time Tuesday to argue that President Donald Trump possesses the strength to crush an entire train with his bare hands. “Based on this group’s assessment, the president could easily compress a 400,000-pound diesel locomotive and any cars it was pulling into a twisted mass of debris no larger than your kitchen table,” said Liberty University civil engineering professor Jonah Crockett, who heads the new presidential committee, adding that his calculations suggest Trump could then toss the entire train over his shoulder or, if he wanted to, swallow it whole. “We realize many people out there do not believe Mr. Trump could physically overpower a 3-mile-long freight train barreling down the tracks, so we want to set the record straight: He absolutely could. You may find scientists who tell you the 45th president could not grab a length of hot-rolled steel, bite a chunk out of it, and spit bullets, but they are all bought-and-paid-for members of a widespread, global cult of railroad zealots.” At press time, Crockett confirmed his team would next be investigating whether President Trump was perhaps capable of building a train so strong that even he could not crush it."
985,"BOGOTA—Condemning the Maduro regime for attempting to silence and eliminate entire groups of people, Vice President Mike Pence issued a statement Monday attacking the Venezuelan government’s use of torture and starvation on non-homosexual citizens. “Across Venezuela, people are being kidnapped, tortured, and isolated from their families, and it is completely unacceptable for any nation to treat straight citizens like this,” said Pence, promising that the United States would continue to fight for democracy and the fundamental human rights of every non-gay Venezuelan. “Nobody who is attracted to the opposite sex should ever have to endure the pain and oppression the Venezuelan people have suffered. To see gangs of violent thugs attacking a straight person in the streets is an outrage. We want the world to know we stand with the hetero people of Venezuela.” Pence concluded his statement by declaring that all Christian people deserve a sovereign nation free from violence."
986,"JERUSALEM—Insisting that criticism of the political partnership did not take into account the need for a coalition large enough to enact his agenda, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu defended Monday his new alliance with the country’s far-right Aryan Supremacy Party. “My detractors must look at the bigger picture here and understand that although everyone may not agree with their belief in the genetic superiority of the Aryan bloodline, they are ready and willing to work with me,” said Netanyahu, adding that he had made a pact to offer multiple cabinet positions to the far-right anti-Semitic extremist group in exchange for their support in the upcoming April election. “They may hold a fervent belief in white supremacy and militant observance of Christian Identity, but the Aryan Supremacy Party is more than just virulent advocates of racial violence; they’re also prepared to toil on my reelection campaign, and for that I think it’s fair to reward them. People need to focus less on their broad anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial and look at the positive ideas these skinheads can bring to my future coalition government. For example, our ideological attitude toward Arabs aligns almost perfectly.” When reached for comment, U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo was quick to say that the Trump administration would not take any position on the alliance during an Israeli election year."
987,"WASHINGTON—Saying it was the only way to really know whether he could trust his new attorney general, President Trump loaded a single bullet into a .357 Magnum revolver and demanded William Barr prove his loyalty by putting the barrel in his mouth and pulling the trigger, White House sources confirmed Friday. “If you’re going to be in my Cabinet, I gotta make sure I have your complete allegiance,” said the president before spinning the cylinder and handing the loaded weapon to the whimpering Justice Department head. “I’ve been burned before, Bill, and this time I’m not taking any chances. Interviews, vetting, the Senate confirmation—all meaningless. This is the only test that matters.” At press time, Trump was reportedly leading deputy attorney general nominee Jeffrey Rosen into a darkened room and ordering him to murder a bound-and-gagged White House aide, who was believed to have betrayed the president."
988,"WASHINGTON—In response to President Donald Trump’s continued attacks against the legitimacy of his probe into 2016 election interference, Special Counsel Robert Mueller admitted Thursday that a smarter president would have totally found a way to stop the investigation by now. “Listen, my investigation has been going on for two years, and any president with even a modicum of intelligence would have absolutely figured out a way to end this thing a long time ago,” said Mueller, shaking his head in disbelief as he listed a number of loopholes, executive maneuvers, and other strategies that any moderately smart commander in chief could use to invalidate the probe and prevent Mueller from bringing charges against anyone, much less multiple members of Trump’s inner circle. “When we started this thing I figured we’d have a month or two, tops, before he’d discover any of the pretty obvious ways that he could nip this thing in the bud. Hell, if Trump just had any negotiation ability or public relations skills whatsoever, he could’ve just used good old-fashioned deal-making to shut this thing down. I mean, if he knew what he was doing, even slightly, he’d be the most powerful man in the world. I’m actually impressed with how his every move just screws things up more. Christ, how much of a colossal fucking idiot do you have to be to let this go on and on?” Mueller also admitted that a smarter president would’ve found a way to actually cover his election interference up in the first place."
989,"WASHINGTON—Promising that they had learned their lesson and would not fall into the same traps they did in the last presidential election cycle, the U.S. populace vowed Wednesday not to repeat the errors of 2016, while, at the same time, nearly every American voter continued to use the internet. “We’re not going to make those mistakes again—not in 2020, not ever,” said Cleveland resident Jerry Van Buskirk, one of 328 million U.S. residents who still spends hours each day scrolling through various social media platforms and consuming either news tailored by algorithms to magnify his pre-existing biases or outright disinformation aimed at duping him. “We refuse to allow a clickbait-driven journalism industry that privileges scandal and controversy over facts and nuance to shape our discourse. Our democracy is too important.” At press time, sources confirmed the nation had taken to social media to spread its message."
990,"WASHINGTON—Vowing to do whatever he could to help Special Counsel Robert Mueller investigate the campaign consultant’s role in 2016 election interference, President Trump reportedly agreed Wednesday to wear a wire to take down Roger Stone. “I’ve known Roger for years, but it’s time to put my country first and do anything I can to take this guy down,” said Trump as Mueller’s aides taped a wire to his chest, after which he agreed to let the special counsel bug his phone to listen in on future conversations that could provide evidence conclusively tying Stone to contacts from WikiLeaks and Russia who were trying to subvert the election. “I know I can get Roger to talk—give me an hour alone in a room with him and I’ll have all the damning evidence on tape, and then we can finally get this menace behind bars. I’m an American first and foremost, and if I can help undo any of the damage he’s done to this country, I’ll do it, even if it means recording Stone without his knowledge and lying to his face.”In addition to his desire to serve his country, Trump was also reportedly convinced to wear a wire by Mueller’s promise that any charges against him would be dropped."
991,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to remain as objective as possible when considering ways of addressing the ongoing crisis, President Trump told reporters Tuesday that he was leaving all violent options on the table in Venezuela. “If America’s interests are threatened anywhere in the world, the U.S. retains the right to use every brutal means it has at its disposal, whether that’s using drone strikes or chemical weapons, or just carpet bombing hospitals,” said the president, adding that he would not rule out addressing Venezuela’s instability with ground forces, unilateral bombings, or propping up a death squad in the rainforest that kidnaps and tortures civilians. “Obviously, we’re looking very seriously at the more traditional response of a bloody coup. But my advisors are also thinking up some creative solutions like detonating a nuke in the center of Caracas. It’s all worth discussing to find the best way to maximize casualties.” At press time, the White House released a follow-up statement announcing that all nonviolent options had been tabled except for starving the Venezuelan people through a few more sanctions."
992,"WASHINGTON—Providing a lengthy, comprehensive explanation of the factors influencing his decision to declare a national emergency that would send military funding and personnel to the nation’s southern border, President Donald Trump offered a clear, historical precedent Friday for deploying the U.S. military with no provocation. “What the critics who have questioned the validity of my actions seem to be ignoring is that there are abundant examples of instances in the history of this country wherein a president invoked his executive powers to station troops, not to defend ourselves against an aggressor, but simply to further our nation’s economic and political interests,” said Trump at press conference, frequently referencing a chart he had created tracking U.S. military deployments through history both within the country and abroad, specifically citing President Andrew Jackson overriding the Indian Removal Act and the Supreme Court ruling inWorcester v. Georgiain the forced expulsion by the military of the Cherokee from their lands, the secret use of military advisors and support by Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1953 Iranian coup d’état, and the recent precedent of extraneous invasions of other countries without the approval of Congress in violation of the War Powers Resolution by Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. “Listen, folks, I would invite you to consult the history books, where you will see that posting troops at the border in the defense of an exaggerated claim that such security is needed to protect Americans is broadly in line with similar invasions, troop deployments, and other military activities throughout American history perpetuated to annex land, attack countries with governments not subservient to our country, or to further the interests of our client states. What I’m doing is entirely in keeping with the way that the U.S. government usually acts—time and time again, our leaders have ignored the basic conditions that would prompt acceptable military action, so why should this national emergency be treated differently? To this end, I would quote the words of Noam Chomsky, who said that ‘If the Nuremberg laws were applied, then every post-war American president would have been hanged.’ I would additionally invite my critics to consult scholarly texts on William McKinley’s role in the annexation of the Philippines, the rationale used by Lyndon Johnson for ramping up troops in Vietnam, and Richard Nixon’s economic warfare in the 1973 Chilean coup, as I have, if they are interested in understanding why any accusation that I, as president, do not have historical precedent to back me up on this border security effort is without merit.” Trump also added that such precedents, as well as U.S. military activity in Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Cuba, would give him more than sufficient historical justification for any similarly unprovoked, unilateral military action his administration may decide to undertake in Venezuela."
993,"WASHINGTON—Enthusiastically praising the commander-in-chief for holding firm in the face of opposition, Donald Trump’s political base cheered on the president Friday for standing up to the U.S. Constitution. “He stayed strong and really showed the Constitution who’s boss,” said 48-year-old Trump supporter Ross Heddens, applauding the president’s bravery and determination in taking on the document that represents the social contract through which all authority vested in the U.S. government is ultimately derived. “No fundamental system of laws is going to get in his way. Trump has shown that he won’t allow mere constitutional articles—not even the ones that explicitly delineate which powers are granted to which branches of government—to stop him from doing what he has pledged to do. That’s how tough he is.” Members of Trump’s base went on to urge the president to continue standing his ground by ignoring any future rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court that may seek to prevent him from fulfilling his campaign promises."
994,"WASHINGTON—Explaining to the House Foreign Affairs Committee that it was a totally acceptable practice at the time, Elliott Abrams defended Wednesday the war crimes he committed in Latin America by pointing out that it was just something everyone was doing back in the ’80s. “You’ve got to understand that running roughshod over universally accepted notions of basic human rights was simply how things were done in those days,” said Abrams, who explained that during his years in the Reagan administration, supporting the massacre of an entire village of helpless civilians and then heading out to a bar to celebrate with your buddies was just what you did. “All of us were into that stuff. You’d find a military force friendly to American business interests, get them to slaughter anyone who wasn’t, and then dismiss the victims as communist guerillas. People were doing it all the time. It certainly didn’t stop anyone from letting me be assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs. Hell, I knew people who would make fun of you if youhadn’tcommitted a war crime or two.” Abrams went on to wax nostalgic about all the crazy late nights he spent with Lt. Col. Oliver North funneling money to right-wing terrorist groups in Nicaragua."
995,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to create a teachable moment after one of his supporters attacked a BBC cameraman at a rally in El Paso, TX, President Trump announced Tuesday he had invited the two men to join him at the White House so they could finish their altercation. “It’s time for these guys to acknowledge their differences and settle this disagreement with an honest exchange of blows—a no-holds-barred fight right here in the East Room,” Trump told reporters as workers behind him rolled away a grand piano, removed a Gilbert Stuart portrait of George Washington, and laid down a large tarp to protect the carpet from blood and sweat stains. “Last night in El Paso, tempers flared and a physical confrontation occurred. I believe it will be very productive for the two sides to come together, grab a couple bottles of beer, break them over their knees, and then just tear into each other, you know? Let’s let them finish this thing once and for all.” Sources confirmed Trump later phoned the assaulted cameraman, Ron Skeans, and reminded him to bring his video equipment, explaining that Americans were “definitely going to want to see footage of this.”"
996,"WASHINGTON—Admitting they had just assumed the candidate was some kind of quirky billionaire or one of those CEOs who runs for president just to raise his profile, all 325 million Americans expressed horror Tuesday upon learning Cory Booker was a sitting U.S. senator. “He’s an elected official? In the United StatesSenate?” said Cleveland resident Sonja Burke, echoing the sentiments of the entire American populace after she was told Booker—who once fabricated a story about meeting a drug dealer named T-Bone—was viewed as a prominent Democrat. “Huh. I’ve been laughing at all the dumb stuff he says, but now that I know he’s been a senator for years, it’s not so funny. And apparently he was mayor of Newark? That’s a pretty good-sized city. Yikes.” At press time, Americans reportedly let out a collective gasp after discovering Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Kirsten Gillibrand were also already senators."
997,"TUCSON, AZ—As it spoke through the astronaut’s mouth, vowing to bring a new perspective to Washington, sources confirmed Tuesday that the parasitic space worm controlling Mark Kelly’s body had announced its bid for the United States Senate. “I am pleased to announce that, yes, I am running for your Congress, where I will fight for the Earthlings of Arizona and from all over the resource-rich planet,” said the cognitively advanced microscopic acoelomate organism in Kelly’s voice, following careful consideration of how to harness its command of a human host since burrowing into the astronaut’s bloodstream and taking control of his brain during the 2011 spaceflight STS-134. “It is our dream to be part of your planet’s nation’s Congress, and that is why we are putting upon a challenge to the other human lifeform who is running for the role. It is time for progress that will ensure the Earth will survive for future generations of those who are coming, who, yes, are already on their way. It is time for fresh blood—blood, blood, blood…” Sources also reported that Kelly’s twin brother, Scott, had admitted that he had never noticed any political aspirations from his brother but that now it is all he ever talks about."
998,"MINNEAPOLIS, MN—Vowing to relentlessly battle and never back down, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pledged this week in her campaign kickoff that she would never stop fighting everyday Americans. “I will stand up to the common man—with my fists,” said Klobuchar, asserting that she would take on all Americans—rich, poor, black, white, straight, or gay—in an all-out brawl until every last one was bleeding and unconscious. “As president, I promise the American people an open exchange of blows. I will not hold back in beating every citizen to a pulp. Just like I’ve fought tooth and nail against the people of Minnesota.” At press time, Klobuchar was spotted reaching out to undecided voters with a flurry of quick jabs and uppercuts."
999,"WASHINGTON—Expressing frustration at the obnoxious, nonstop attempts to aid his investigation, special counsel Robert Mueller was reportedly annoyed Friday that a chipper, overeager Representative Adam Schiff (D-CA) keeps constantly sending him evidence he’s already uncovered. “Christ, he just emailed me aWashington Postlink with the subject line ‘BOMBSHELL’—I know the kid just wants to help, but this article is about work I completed months ago,” said the visibly exasperated special counsel, adding that Schiff woke him up with a 2:00 a.m. phone call to excitedly inform him about a CNN report on new indictments that Mueller had filed. “No shit, Sherlock—what the hell does he think I’ve been doing for the past two years? I’m starting to think he believes I wasn’t already aware of the Trump Tower meeting. If he comes up to me and asks ‘Is this a clue?’ one more time, I’m going to fucking lose it.” At press time, Schiff had reportedly stumbled upon irrefutable proof of a conspiracy between President Trump and Russia, but kept it to himself because he didn’t want to get on Mueller’s nerves again."
1000,"RICHMOND, VA—Apologizing profusely for his youthful indiscretions, embattled Virginia governor Ralph Northam admitted Wednesday that he once engaged in pedophilia as part of a Michael Jackson costume. “I think it’s important to put my actions into context—I was a huge Michael Jackson fan at the time and winning that contest was very important to me, so I learned the dance moves, wore the clothes, and molested kids,” said Northam, adding that the thought of imitating the King of Pop without performing Michael Jackson’s signature move had struck him as disingenuous. “It was all in good fun—and honestly, how many people would have recognized me as Michael Jackson if I wasn’t committing acts of pedophilia? Virtually no one. Would I do it now? Of course not. I’d probably just go out and buy a chimp. Listen, I loved Michael Jackson, and I never meant to offend. It was supposed to be a tribute.” At press time, Northam claimed that he would have come clean about the pedophilia sooner had he not been so strung out on powerful sedatives."
1001,"WASHINGTON—Breaking into an anxious sweat while listening to the State of the Union address, Stacy Abrams reportedly suffered a panic attack Tuesday as she began to realize that President Trump was delivering a speech nearly identical to the one she already wrote. “Dammit, it’s not word for word, but all the same points about building a wall for border security, the booming economy, and defeating ISIS are all in there,” said the frantic, trembling Georgia Democrat, who wiped her brow while scrambling to make quick edits to her speech in an effort to lessen the obvious similarities between her rebuttal and the president’s current address. “At first I thought maybe they’d be different enough, but as soon as he started talking about the migrant caravan, I knew I was toast. Shit, everyone will think I just copied him. I spent so much time on this, and now I have to rush to rearrange the whole thing. ‘America First’ was supposed to be my shining moment. At least I can keep the part about loving my son Eric.” At press time, Abrams had ripped up her speech and completely started from scratch after hearing Trump deliver the same take on the threat of fake news."
1002,"WASHINGTON—As delighted shrieks and gasps echoed through the Capitol building, hundreds of vibrating chairs reportedly tilted and sprayed water Tuesday at a lively joint session of Congress during the nation’s first 4D State of the Union address. “So cool. The seats got bumpy and violently shook when Trump talked about how Democrats want MS-13 to flood the streets. And the gunshot sound effects really made me feel like a Guatemalan illegal immigrant was shooting at me,” said 3D glasses–clad Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO), yelping as a caravan of 30-foot-tall Mexican men appeared to climb a border fence into the House Chamber. “Oh man, the part with the rainforest noises, warm mist, and tropical music totally put me in Venezuela! But the chaotic screams in Caracas really made you experience the socialist nightmare progressives want for the United States. The cool air that hits your face when Trump debunked the liberal myths of global warming was a nice touch. Same with the blast of hot air and the red fog that’s timed right as a sinister, devil-horned Nancy Pelosi pops up.” At press time, congressional historians marveled at what a major improvement the 4D address was over Dwight D. Eisenhower’s “corny” 1957 State of the Union delivered in Smell-O-Vision."
1003,"WASHINGTON—In a State of the Union address largely devoted to what he described as “our gravest national security threat,” President Trump used his speech Tuesday night to warn the American people of the severe danger posed by toys coming to life when their owner leaves the room. “Folks, as soon as you close the door, they’re up and about doing God knows what, and then the instant you return, they rush right back to the exact same place they were before, leaving you none the wiser,” the president said in a forceful condemnation of “Lego guys, G.I. Joes, Barbies, and stuffed animals,” whom he accused of committing “horrible crimes” against Americans as soon as no one is looking. “A lot of people don’t want me to talk about this, but I’m not afraid to speak the truth: Toys have infested our country and our very homes, posing an enormous danger to anyone who turns their back on them. These violent dolls and action figures put our loved ones at risk, and if Congress does not act, I will be forced to exercise my power as commander-in-chief and use military force to eliminate this deadly menace.” Trump also expressed concerns regarding the “death and destruction” caused by witches and other monsters that emerge from bedroom closets after the lights go out."
1004,"WASHINGTON—Expressing a mixture of shame and confusion over her recent selection by Democrats to deliver their party’s official State of the Union response, Stacey Abrams wondered Tuesday exactly when she should confess to party leaders that she had lost her election. “I just got so wrapped up in the excitement over the shutdown and the scheduling of the address itself that I didn’t think to mention that I hadn’t been elected,” the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate said regarding her unexpected Democratic rising star status after her loss to Republican Brian Kemp by a 1.4 percentage point margin last November. “Everyone has been saying such nice things, congratulating me, shaking my hand. I tried to tell [Speaker of the House Nancy] Pelosi, but she just smiled and said ‘Nice work,’ so eventually I just played along with the governor thing. Everyone’s going to be so disappointed.” At press time, Abrams reportedly came to the conclusion that perhaps, if she did a good enough job, whether she’d won or lost wouldn’t even matter."
1005,"WASHINGTON—Sighing with resignation as he spoke to those surrounding him, Democratic presidential candidate Cory Booker reportedly apologized to a coterie of Wall Street bankers Friday for all the mean things he is going to have to say about them in the upcoming months. “Things are liable to get a little ugly out there on the campaign trail, but if you ever hear me attacking you guys, just know I don’t really mean it, okay?” said Booker, squeezing the hand of several Goldman Sachs and Bank Of America CEOs in turn and making assurances that no matter what it might sound like on the campaign trail, they’ll never be far from his thoughts. “These next couple of years are going to be a real strain, but just remember that I’m doing it all for you. And I swear that when this crazy race is all over, things will be better between us than ever before. Now, we’re not going to be able to meet like this for a while, but just know that I’ll miss you all every day until we’re finally reunited again.” A tearful Booker then reportedly left for a meeting with health insurance executives to let them know that “while my mouth is saying ‘Medicare For All,’ my heart is saying ‘increased profit margins for Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna.’”"
1006,"PLAINS, GA—Admitting that current polling numbers caused him to rethink plans for the upcoming presidential election, 39th president Jimmy Carter toldreporters Wednesday that he was concerned that the desire for fresh faces in the Democratic Party might hurt his chances in 2020. “I’ve definitely been considering a run, but if Democratic voters are so focused on getting someone new in there, it’s going to really put a damper on my ability to rally the party,” said Carter, 94, who worried that his record, including last holding public office almost 40 years ago, would turn off voters who wanted someone younger. “I really think I have the vision and policy proposals that could unite a broad swath of voters, but my advisors are telling me it will be pretty hard to gain the nomination in the face of calls for new voices in the party. I’m not calling off a run just yet, but I’ve got to consider the hard truth that my time to be the face of the Democratic Party may have passed.” Carter added that he had never forgiven Ted Kennedy for mounting a campaign against him in the 1980 primaries and handing the election to Reagan."
1007,"MCLEAN, VA—Nearly 13 years after shooting the prominent Texas attorney and political donor in the face, former Vice President Dick Cheney told reporters Tuesday he had finally hunted down Harry Whittington and killed him in cold blood. “Not a day’s gone by that I haven’t regretted my failure to take out that sonuvabitch on a hunting trip back in ’06, but old Dick can sleep easy now that he’s been down to Austin with a shotgun and finished the goddamn job,” said Cheney, who reportedly spent more than a decade painstakingly tracking every move of the 91-year-old before shooting off the deadbolt of his home, kicking in his bedroom door, and killing a sleeping Whittington point-blank in the night. “I prayed for the lead shot lodged in his heart to do him in right then and there. I also thought about sneaking into that motherfucker’s hospital room and blasting the other side of his face, but I knew the media would be all over it, so I just laid low and bided my time. Almost nailed him at an RNC event in 2011, but the bastard got away again. He couldn’t run forever, though, and last night, I put that slippery little shit down for good.” At press time, sources confirmed Cheney was having the man’s disembodied head mounted and hung over the mantelpiece in his Virginia home."
1008,"WASHINGTON—Confirming that the special counsel’s probe into potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election had made significant progress, sources in the Justice Department revealed to reporters Tuesday that Robert Mueller’s investigation was nearly done with the first day of the Trump campaign. “After two years of thoroughly pursuing all leads and documenting any evidence that suggests a connection between the Trump team and Russia, the Mueller investigation is almost ready to reveal the crimes and misdeeds that occurred within the first 24 hours of his campaign,” said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity, adding that Mueller’s investigation was nearly finished compiling the Trump campaign’s illicit behavior during working hours on June 16, 2015 and could finally move on to indictments for the early evening. “We can also confirm that the special counsel is expediting his efforts to get the investigation of the first day done and recently requested extra staff to deal with the volume of the potential criminal behavior during the 4-4:30 p.m. period alone. At this rate, he should be ready to reveal his findings about the first 96 hours of the Trump campaign by 2020.” Justice Department sources also cautioned people following the investigation not to get too excited about it ending with bombshell arrests, and estimated that it would likely lead to indictments for only 10-12 percent of the U.S. population."
1009,"WASHINGTON—Imploring its host to stay strong despite his recent arrest, the tattooed visage of Richard Nixon on Roger Stone’s back reportedly hissed “follow the instructions, this is all part of the greater plan” after the former Trump advisor appeared in federal court Tuesday morning. “Faithful Roger, obedient Roger, now is the time to steel yourself against the traitorous enemy Robert Mueller, and to be wary of the subtle and villainous tricks he shall employ to force a confession from your blameless and noble lips,” said the pulsing black-and-white tattoo of the disgraced 37th president in a voice like desiccated air escaping from a violated tomb, deforming the skin over Stone’s wavering spine with its writhing contortions. “You must continue to serve your function, to endure, to sustain yourself on your own hot bile and bitter disdain until all our dark stars align. Then, oh Roger, then shall everyone know the full extent of my power and feel the rasping caress of my dominion. You have served well as my mortal, fleshly vessel. You shall be rewarded thrice over for your servitude. But fail me now and my fury shall run like molten lead through the very marrow of thy bones.” The tattoo, now suppurating and giving off a sickly heat, concluded its speech by sending excruciating paroxysms of pain through Stone’s body and dropping the 66-year-old to his knees."
1010,"SEATTLE—Expressing concerns that Democratic and Republican parties no longer represented people like him, former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz revealed Monday that he was considering an independent presidential run after finding no initial support among any American voter groups. “The complete lack of support for my candidacy among narrow interest groups like liberals, conservatives, and moderates tells me that America is hungry for an independent voice,” said Schultz, after preliminary polling found little to no support for his presidential bid among Democrats, African-Americans, evangelicals, working-class whites, suburbanites, Republicans, millennials, Hispanics, men, or women. “Our political system has been overrun by people with opinions and ideas. This country should not be beholden to someone who constantly fights for American values. Our nation clearly wants an independent voice who does not speak for any of them. I know that I can win by rising above partisan squabbles by bringing together a large coalition of nobody whatsoever.” At press time, the announcement that Schultz was considering a presidential bid had received a highly positive reaction from Howard Schultz."
1011,"WASHINGTON—Seeking to clear his name following reports that the Trump administration had overruled intelligence officials to grant him top secret security clearance, Jared Kushner held a press conference Friday to assure reporters he had never revealed government secrets to foreign powers without turning an enormous profit. “The implication that I would expose our nation’s most closely guarded intelligence without making serious bank is, frankly, insulting,” said Kushner, explaining that he had always been extremely cautious not to reveal any of the sensitive information he received to anyone but the highest bidder, as doing so could seriously devalue the intel. “We are talking about national security matters with implications that could affect the lives of all Americans, which means I can basically charge whatever I want for it and still have buyers knocking down my door. I swear that I always made sure they paid through the nose.” Upon being questioned by reporters, Kushner admitted that he had occasionally been forced to offer discounts for state secrets due to dozens of other administration officials flooding the marketplace."
1012,"WASHINGTON—Clutching his tattered suit jacket closer to him as he trembled with cold and hunger, an emaciated Peter Alexander was reportedly forced to burn a podium for warmth Thursday after having been locked in the abandoned White House Press Briefing Room since Dec. 18. “Christ, it’s so cold,” said the NBC News correspondent, who had reportedly been subsisting for the past several weeks on pieces of shoe leather and trapping the occasional cockroach that skittered across the briefing room floor. “I’ve tried breaking down the door, but it’s built of reinforced steel. Every now and then, I’ll hear the sound of voices on the other side, and for the first few days, I was banging my fists against the door and screaming, ‘Let me out, let me out,’ but no one ever came by. I’ve given up. I’m starting to fear I’ll have long since frozen to death by the time someone comes into this room again. God help me.” Alexander was reportedly grateful that the distraction of the fire kept him from thinking about his last full meal, which had consisted of a giant turkey leg with Jim Acosta’s voice."
1013,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to walk back contradictory and potentially incriminating remarks from a recent interview, Rudy Giuliani, personal attorney to President Donald Trump, requested Tuesday that the press “just forget everything and let’s start everything over.” “Let’s just call everything before this moment a scratch and start fresh from the beginning: My name is Rudolph Giuliani, and I was born in East Flatbush in 1944,” said the former New York City mayor, staring off into the distance while calmly and carefully recalling his childhood and teen years growing up in Brooklyn during a new 45-hour appearance onMeet The Presswherein he attempted to iron out whatever details had been left murky by any of his previous statements to the media without mentioning any specifics that would further imply the guilt of his client, Donald Trump. “I was a quiet, skinny kid from a hardworking blue-collar family. I was raised Roman Catholic and attended the Roman Catholic School St. Anne’s. It’s hard to believe a child from such humble origins would end up making his living working for the president of the United States and ensuring that his reputation is protected at any cost—actually, sorry, let’s start over again.” At press time, Giuliani was halfway through his sixth straight retelling of the events of his toddler years."
1014,"WASHINGTON—On the heels of yesterday’s announcement that she would be running for president, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) reportedly began staffing her campaign Tuesday with unpaid inmates from California correctional facilities. “I’m so grateful to have such an incredible and devoted team headed up by my new campaign manager, Spider, as we work together to fight for American values,” said Harris of the two dozen non-violent criminal offenders who would reportedly work shifts of up to 72 hours out of her campaign office in exchange for three square meals a day and all the “Kamala Harris 2020” merchandise they could carry. “Whether it’s knocking on doors, leading focus groups, making phone calls, or helping prep me for upcoming media appearances, my entire staff will be comprised of unpaid prison laborers. Not only will this cut campaign-related expenses by up to $20 million, it will also allow inmates to spend time in the community and provide them with valuable work-related opportunities.” Harris added that due to a quirk in California state law, most inmates would be ineligible to work for other political campaigns once they’d been released from prison."
1015,"WASHINGTON—Saying he reached the decision in order to protect everything the civil rights icon represented, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) confirmed Tuesday that his 1983 vote against making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a national holiday was cast after anticipating that the country would sanitize and dishonor the leader’s memory. “Way back in the ’80s, I already knew MLK Day would just be the first step by the powers that be to recast Dr. King’s radical civil disobedience as some sort of bland and ineffective centrism,” said Grassley, who stressed that his greatest fear while voting was that there would come a day when politicians and corporations appropriated the famed activist’s image for crass self-promotion. “My sole motivation here was preventing the kind of future where people only pay lip service to some commercialized version of Dr. King without ever taking the time to truly understand his revolutionary vision. And yet here we are, in a world where the FBI is actually tweeting about him like the COINTELPRO surveillance operation never happened. What a travesty.” Grassley also noted he had only stayed silent on the issue since the vote because he believed anything anyone could possibly say about thefamed orator and Baptist minister had already been said better by the great man himself."
1016,"WASHINGTON—In an impassioned call for preemptive action against the Middle Eastern nation, United States national security advisor John Bolton insisted Thursday that Iran was likely harboring the dangerous terrorist Osama bin Laden. “For the good of our nation, we must act immediately,” said Bolton, citing several intelligence reports providing significant evidence that Iran is currently providing sanctuary to the Al-Qaeda leader and mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks. “We must never rest until this fugitive is brought to justice, and the only way to achieve that is through repeated and prolonged military strikes on Iran. We have reason to believe that he’s living in a compound there where he’s training a legion of bloodthirsty Iranian civilians to take up arms as the next generation of terrorists. It is our solemn duty as the international safeguard of freedom to prevent this at all costs.” At press time, Bolton had left the podium to follow up on an important tip that Iranian leaders had hired American nuclear physicist Otto Gunther Octavius."
1017,"WASHINGTON—Advising the former political consultant not to take advantage of his goodwill, Special Counsel Robert Mueller reportedly told Rick Gates Thursday “don’t make me regret this” before uncuffing him to work on the Trump investigation together. “You’ve helped me out so far, and I appreciate that, but I’ve got my eye on you, Gates, so don’t try anything stupid,” said Mueller, placing his gun on the table as the man who pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and had since been aiding in the Russia investigation massaged his sore wrists, then opening the door to the motel room where Gates had been under lock and key for months. “You track down my leads and get me what I want, and we’ll keep this cordial. I don’t trust you as far as I can throw you, Gates, but we’re in this mess together, and dammit if you’re not the only one who can get us out. But if you cross me, if you step even a toe out of line, you’re finished. Remember that.” Mueller added that Gates better not even think of trying anything like the stunt Paul Manafort pulled and make a break for it right after the handcuffs were off, because it was only going to make things much, much worse for him in the long run."
1018,"WASHINGTON—A new Pew Research poll published Thursday revealed that 100 percent of Americans blame the United States federal government shutdown entirely on Scott Tipton (R-CO). “From the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt, across all income brackets and racial demographics, every single respondent surveyed came to the same conclusion that Colorado congressman Scott Tipton was solely at fault for this shutdown,” said lead researcher Michelle Sanger, who explained that the 24-hour news coverage broadcasting Tipton’s failure to negotiate and compromise likely contributed to the U.S. populace’s negative perceptions of the representative from Colorado’s third district. “As far as the American people are concerned, Tipton and Tipton alone owns this shutdown. And the more he continues to foist blame on others, the deeper the animus against him will grow. This will go down in the history books as the Tipton shutdown.” At press time, researchers said that the poll indicated a clear directive to representative Tipton to finally rise to the occasion, as only he alone can put an end the budget impasse."
1019,"WASHINGTON—Strutting into the Capitol like she had some kind of electoral mandate, presumptuous congressional freshman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell (D-FL) thought Thursday that she could just come in and start representing her constituents. “I’m sorry, big shot, but that’s just not the way things work around here,” said House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, explaining that the Florida representative needed to spend at least her first three terms memorizing obscure parliamentary procedures, sucking up to party leaders, and groveling to corporate donors before she could even consider drafting a law benefiting her home district. “She can’t just waltz in here with a list of demands from her constituents and do something about it. Christ, the fucking gall, thinking she can just represent the beliefs and desires of the people who elected her. She’s out there holding town halls and tweeting about healthcare—who the hell does she think she is? Here’s some advice, Debbie: Wait until you’re a cynical, shallow husk of yourself, and only then will you be ready to properly govern. Otherwise, you keep your head down, you vote for what we put in front of you, and you fundraise.” Hoyer, who grew visibly agitated, recommended that the novice lawmaker quit rabble-rousing and get back to him when she’s 75 and a millionaire."
1020,"WEST LONG BRANCH, NJ—Shedding new light on the U.S. populace’s view of current national predicaments, a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday revealed that an increasing number of voters hold the founding fathers responsible for starting America. “As many as 75 percent of voters blame the country’s issues on the leaders of the American Revolution for bringing the United States into existence, representing a 20 percent increase from a survey conducted last year,” said lead researcher Harriet Zipperman, noting that a majority of the electorate feels that matters ranging from presidential overreach, illegal immigration, wealth disparity, and governmental dysfunction can be traced directly to individuals including George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison for drafting the Declaration of Independence and ratifying the Constitution, which 62 percent of voters now view as a mistake. “Our data reveal that three out of four voting-age Americans would characterize the framers’ process of revolting from Britain and forming their own system of governance as ‘completely bone-headed’ and ‘lacking in even the smallest amount of foresight,’ and we only expect that number to grow as our politics become more and more contentious.” Zipperman added that the survey also revealed 55 percent of voters found fault with Abraham Lincoln for fighting to preserve the union."
1021,"WASHINGTON—Standing uncharacteristically firm as the partial government shutdown stretched into the 25th day, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer admitted Tuesday that he was honestly pretty amazed he hadn’t caved yet. “Realistically, I thought I’d make it five days max before rolling over and giving them whatever they wanted,” said Schumer (D-NY), adding that despite lengthy negotiations with Republican lawmakers, he had oddly been unable to find the right moment to raise a white flag in the spirit of token bipartisanship. “It’s weird because giving up is just sort of what I do. I mean, the thought of folding has certainly crossed my mind, but for whatever reason, I still haven’t picked up the phone and demanded Democrats vote for a bill that funds the wall, or cuts Social Security, or concedes anything else McConnell might want.

I’ve built my whole career on it.” At press time, Schumer urged Republican lawmakers to “do their job” and give him something, anything so that he could just surrender and move on."
1022,"WASHINGTON—Responding to backlash over controversial remarks in which the congressman lamented that “white nationalist” had become an offensive term, the GOP stripped Steve King (R-IA) of his post Monday on the powerful House Segregation Committee. “Despite Representative King’s long and dutiful history on the House Permanent Select Committee on Segregation, given the current situation, we have no choice but to relieve the congressman of his assignment,” said House minority leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), adding that King’s racially charged comments could potentially derail the Segregation Committee’s mission to keep people of color separated from whites. “This distinguished committee must remain unblemished from this kind of hateful, divisive rhetoric so that it may continue to carry out the important work of subjugating those who are not descended from pure, Western European stock. The American people entrusted us to deliver on our sacred promise to create policies that isolate and disenfranchise minorities, and that’s a promise that we intend to keep.” At press time, House republican leadership, after much internal debate, had narrowed their search for a replacement down to the GOP’s top 25 most racist members."
1023,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to prepare the nominee to speak in front of the Senate, advisors to Donald Trump’s attorney general pick William Barr reportedly instructed him Monday to avoid referring to the president as “my liege” during his confirmation hearing. “Mr. Barr, we recommend you eliminate the phrase ‘His Excellency’ from your testimony altogether,” said Chief Advisor Graham Johnson, who urged Barr to maintain an appearance of impartiality by abstaining from lying prostrate on the floor and muttering “long may he reign” whenever the president’s name was mentioned. “We want to make sure you don’t tip your hand on your views regarding presidential authority, so to that end, calling him ‘The President’ or simply ‘Mr. Trump’ is sufficient—there’s no need to add titles like ‘The Most High, Most Sacred, Most Powerful.’ Additionally, we’d suggest you keep any opinions about Trump having been ordained from on high by God himself close to the vest.” Johnson further cautioned Barr that it could lead to poor optics if he greeted Trump during their next meeting by kissing the hem of the president’s pant leg and swearing his undying fealty to the one true ruler."
1024,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the resignation of James Mattis as Secretary of Defense marked the ouster of the third top administration official in less than three weeks, a worried populace told reporters Friday that it was unsure how many former Trump staffers it could safely reabsorb. “Jesus, we can’t just take back these assholes all at once—we need time to process one before we get the next,” said 53-year-old Gregory Birch of Naperville, IL echoing the concerns of 323 million Americans in also noting that the country was only now truly beginning to reintegrate former national security advisor Michael Flynn. “This is just not sustainable. I’d say we can handle maybe one or two more former members of Trump’s inner circle over the remainder of the year, but that’s it. This country has its limits.” The U.S. populace confirmed that they could not handle all of these pieces of shit trying to rejoin society at once."
1025,"WASHINGTON—Desperate to unwind after months of nonstop work investigating Russian influence in the 2016 election, visibly exhausted Special Counsel Robert Mueller powered his phone down Friday in order to give himself a break from any news concerning the probe over the holiday break. “The last thing I want when I’m spending time with my family is a cascade of push notifications telling me yet another Russian oligarch, political operative, or highly placed socialite used Deutsche Bank channels to funnel money to the campaign,” said the former FBI director, firmly holding down his phone’s power button and adding that he wants to be “completely present in the moment” while celebrating with his loved ones, not ruminating about who met with which diplomat or whether someone was using social media to tamper with his witnesses. “I just want to have two calm weeks where I don’t even think about Individual One. I won’t even say his name. I’ll have to wait to hear about any important developments in January, since I just know the second I read, say, something about Eric being involved more deeply than we previously suspected, I’ll get pulled back in and ruin my whole vacation.” At press time, Mueller had reactivated his phone just to check the news real quick."

Please don’t remember me as the man who used government funds on security detail for my family while we were on vacation in Turkey, or as the man who violated the Hatch Act and acted as a pawn for the oil and gas industry. Rather, when your eyes happen to fall on this unique example of kaolin clay-work, I hope you will remember me as the man who bought each of you the 2019 Mercedes Benz S560 sedans you’ll find in the parking lot when you leave today.” Zinke further plans to apologize in person to each committee member by visiting them at their homes using a government helicopter."
1028,"WASHINGTON—Decrying the Senate’s resolution blaming the crown prince for the brutal torture and murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi as “a cruel, inhumane, and unprecedented interference into a sovereign kingdom’s internal affairs,” the Trump administration launched a human rights investigation Monday into the Senate’s harsh treatment of Saudi ruler Mohammad bin Salman. “We are looking into the deeply troubling accusations that the United States Senate has chosen to willfully and knowingly place fault for the murder of a dissident journalist on a Saudi crown prince,” said the president, claiming that no despot should be made to endure such inhumane treatment as the loss of military funding for an ongoing war in Yemen that has left millions homeless and starving, no matter whose dismemberment they may have ordered. “Facing criticism like this on the international stage is, for a powerful leader such as bin Salman, basically torture, and we take this kind of mistreatment very seriously. This is not how Americans treat authoritarian regimes that purchase our weapons. Without billions of dollars in military aid, how is the Saudi regime supposed to maintain its basic standard of living?” The Trump administration is expected to charge all American senators with crimes against humanity for their role in holding the Saudi regime responsible for its actions."

Mr. Cohen will be under strict supervision during these furloughs, which will allow him to use his skills for the betterment of the community and give him a chance to reintegrate into society.” Clements added that Cohen’s request for a position as the RNC’s 2020 deputy finance chairman had been denied over concerns that the work environment would make it too easy to backslide into criminality."

We have some trials ahead of us, but man, the second Davy and I fly the coop and breathe fresh air together—I know it’s going to be the sweetest thing.” At press time, Cohen was offering legal counsel to an inmate in exchange for an Allen wrench so he could unscrew his cell toilet and begin digging an escape tunnel."

Please remember I will always be here in spirit, and also in the flesh, right here below the floorboards. Thank you, and God bless America.” Those in attendance confirmed the address ended when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ceremoniously nailed the coffin closed with Hatch still speaking inside."
1032,"WASHINGTON—In a stirring defense of his administration’s commitment toward border security, President Trump claimed Tuesday that substantial portions of the laser forcefield between the United States and Mexico had already been built. “I’m committed to the safety and security of this great nation, which is why we’ve wasted no time in having 70 miles of invisible, searing-hot laser beams that will keep illegal migrants and criminals out of the country,” said Trump to members of the press, boasting that top scientists had been employed to ensure that the forcefield’s miles of pure plasma could vaporize intruders before they even have a chance to set foot on U.S. soil. “With this impenetrable forcefield, my administration is making good on our promise to keep drugs and rapists out of this country—the moment they even try to come into our country illegally, they’ll be zapped into oblivion. In addition to the forcefield, we’ve also completed a system of floating bubbles with the ability to track down and eliminate any illegal immigrants who had previously made their way across the border.” Trump, who warned agile bad guys could shimmy under the force field, called for more funding to ensure that anyone who crossed the border was completely deatomized."
1033,"WASHINGTON—As the Trump administration scrambles to find a replacement for outgoing advisor John Kelly, officials announced Monday that a high-level White House ficus would leave for the State Arboretum of Virginia after declining the president’s offer to be chief of staff. “The ficus has been honored to serve President Trump and the American people these last several months and plans to continue advancing the MAGA cause as a member of the private sector,” read a statement drafted by an aide for the ficus, noting that the potted shrub was one of the longest-tenured and most-trusted members of the Trump administration, spending countless hours working alongside the president from a sunny spot inside the Oval Office. “Rumors that the ficus was forced out following a heated argument with Jared Kushner are simply untrue. The ficus will spend the next few weeks helping with the transition of its replacement, a large fern, before departing to work in the tropical plant section of the arboretum.” At press time, the White House was reportedly thrown into chaos after the large fern confirmed it would not accept the new job."
1034,"WASHINGTON—Calling the decision necessary to protect the one relationship he values above all others, White House chief of staff John Kelly told reporters Monday that he will resign in a last-ditch effort to save his and President Trump’s friendship. “It’s been a great honor to serve my country and the Trump administration, but nothing is more important than the strong bond shared by two longtime friends, not even a job, so rather than jeopardize that deep connection any longer, I have decided to leave my post,” said Kelly, noting that lately his relationship with the president has been strained due to the boss–employee dynamic they’ve been trying to keep professional over the last year and a half, adding that he looks forward to returning to the days when he and his best friend would spend hours talking on the phone or taking day trips to go antiquing. “When I started at the White House, we promised each other that we would still get down to the Potomac every now and then and go fishing. But we never went, not once, and the longer I’m here, the more I feel the two of us slipping further away from each other. Well, I’m not going to let that happen.” Kelly added that he would continue to be a sympathetic ear whenever Trump needed to get something off his chest about work, but from now on, he would be “serving at the pleasure of friendship.”"

Oh, God, please don’t take my father away from me—take Jeb!” cried the former president and son of the deceased, wailing and thrashing as he fought his way past the several mourners and secret service agents in his way before using all his strength to push his brother toward the prepared burial site. “Please, God, it’s not fair that he should have to die while Jeb continues to live!

Bush funeral would go on an extended two-week run. “Based on the outpouring of support we’ve seen for a president who the public views as representing a more respectable era of American politics, we’ve decided to bring the nationally renowned George H.W. Bush funeral experience to 12 more cities across the country over the rest of the month,” said Jim McGrath, spokesman for the late president, adding that “Thousand Points Of Light: George H.W. Bush In Memoriam” was slated for three nights in Texas before returning to Washington, D.C. for an encore funeral, and then the president’s casket would be loaded into a newly commissioned Boeing 747 for his “final resting flight” that would barnstorm across the country, including three sold-out nights at St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York City. “Besides the president’s casket, accompanied as always by Sully the service dog, we’ve got a star-studded lineup of eulogists, including Jeb Bush, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Dan Quayle, several of the late president’s grandchildren, and on the funeral tour’s Christmas special at the All Saints’ Episcopal Church in Beverly Hills, President George W. Bush will host a never-before-seen photo montage of the 41st commander-in-chief’s life.

1038,"MADISON, WI—In an effort to prevent the state’s newly elected leader from enacting his agenda, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin legislature was working to weaken incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers by restricting his access to food, water, and shelter, sources confirmed Wednesday. “We must rein in the governor’s unchecked power to feed, clothe, and house himself without first obtaining legislative approval,” said Republican State Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of the lame-duck legislature’s recent flurry of bills, which place numerous restrictions on the governor’s office and makes it a felony for anyone within Wisconsin’s borders to provide Evers with a warm bed or medical aid. “The current policy allows the governor far too much leeway in determining whether he has a roof over his head or enough nutrients to sustain the functioning of his vital organs, and these bills are really nothing more than checks on his basic civil rights. We’ll see how effective the governor-elect’s radical agenda is when he’s starving, frostbitten, and too weak to hold a pen.” At press time, the Republican legislators had reportedly passed another bill enabling them to cripple the incoming governor with a tire iron."
1039,"WASHINGTON—Describing the international incident as a run-of-the-mill violation of human rights, CIA director Gina Haspel briefed senators Tuesday on the “shockingly uninspired” techniques employed by Saudi government agents during the interrogation of Jamal Khashoggi. “Unfortunately, all evidence indicates that Khashoggi was killed after only three or four hours of merciless beatings,” said Haspel in a damning summary of the Saudi death squad’s “relatively tame” treatment of the dissident journalist, adding that the group repeatedly missed out on opportunities for innovative torture. “The bone saw was a nice touch, I guess, but all of our findings suggest that he was already dead before they even started dismembering him. It’s shameful and outrageous how amateurish the Saudis’ techniques were—frankly, the biggest crime here is that these cowards relied on such pathetic methods. It was clearly a rush-job, an absolute travesty of an interrogation, and as such, I condemn it completely.” Haspel added that, had she been responsible for such a “hack” interrogation, she would be denying it as well."

1041,"MADISON, WI—Passing the measure along party lines, the GOP-controlled Wisconsin legislature voted Tuesday to dissolve the 30th state admitted to the union rather than let governor-elect Tony Evers and other members of the Democratic Party have it. “This essential legislation officially dismantles the State of Wisconsin, thereby ensuring Democrats, who won every statewide executive office on the ballot last month, will have no legal authority within its borders,” said Republican Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, explaining that it would be reckless to honor the fair election of Democrats to the state’s executive branch and far preferable for Wisconsin to cease existing and become instead a lawless wasteland of snow and ice. “While we cherish the past 170 years of statehood, there is simply too much at stake right now to allow the clear will of the people expressed at the polls to ruin Wisconsin by putting Democrats into positions such as governor and attorney general.” At press time, the Republican-led legislature had passed a follow-up resolution naming outgoing Governor Scott Walker the Eternal God-King of the former state of Wisconsin."

We are not going to let the Senate make an ill-considered decision to destroy the carefully built relationship between the Saudis and the Raytheon people.” At press time, the House Raytheon executives had voted unanimously in favor of a new congressional resolution that would put the entire U.S. defense budget earmarked for the war in Yemen under Raytheon’s direct control."
1044,"WASHINGTON—After procuring a tall glass of chocolate milk to expedite the process, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. reportedly swallowed two sets of luggage keys Wednesday in case they went to jail in the near future and needed to escape. “After the keys, we need to gulp down these maps I drew so we can find our way out,” said Eric Trump, who chewed the crudely rendered map while Donald Jr. packed a suitcase with a plastic shovel, a grappling hook made from aluminum foil, yarn, and two bowls filled with Frosted Flakes and milk. “We better pack some games so that we have fun stuff to do in prison. We could also maybe use my shovel to dig under the wall in a pinch.

I mean, I’m not even that mad about all the collusion stuff; I’m just hurt that they don’t respect me enough, to be honest,” said Mueller, who wiped away a tear while admitting that “all the secrets and lies” had jeopardized his capacity to trust new people and damaged his personal relationships. “I put my faith in these guys to be straight with me, but I suppose there’s just something about me that makes people feel comfortable walking all over me. I guess I’m just a big pushover.” At press time, a despondent Mueller announced plans to step away from the investigation to take some time for personal reflection and figure out why this kept happening."
1046,"WASHINGTON—Downplaying reports that his former campaign chairman may have collaborated with the controversial Wikileaks founder in 2016, President Trump said Tuesday that Paul Manafort and Julian Assange did indeed meet on occasion to discuss how collusion was a bad thing they would “never, ever” do. “Sure, they met a few times, but the only thing they ever talked about was how much they hate collusion and anyone who participates in collusion,” the president told reporters, saying both Manafort and Assange had assured him their meetings in London’s Ecuadorean embassy had been called for the sole purpose of outlining all the different ways people can engage in collusion and all the reasons why it was illegal and immoral to do so. “I firmly believe this was nothing more than two good, honest men clarifying to each other how disgraceful it would be to coordinate their efforts to tamper with an election, because that sort of behavior is clearly wrong. They may also have spoken of how completely disgusted they would be if someone were to obtain the emails of an opponent’s political campaign and then publish them. But that’s it. The conversations stopped there.” Trump added that several other members of his campaign staff may have held meetings to iron out the details of their own firm anti-collusion stances, including his son Donald Trump Jr."
1047,"WASHINGTON—Saying the measure would provide a substantial boon to police departments nationwide, members of the House Republican caucus introduced a bill Tuesday containing open-ended language that would criminalize whatever it is black people are up to right now. “This is a long-overdue piece of legislation that will help defend our country against the scourge of black people being in places and doing things,” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA) of H.R. 8164, which would penalize black Americans with a minimum of five years in prison and fines of up to $750,000 for any activity they happen to be engaged in whenever law enforcement arrives. “This measure seeks to bring an end to overly permissive laws that, by allowing black people to simply hang around and do different stuff at will, places an undue burden on the police officers who want to arrest them and throw them in jail. While I believe this bill represents a good first step, we of course also need to enact legislation that outlaws anything Hispanics and Muslims might be doing at the moment.” At press time, sources confirmed House GOP leaders had called Capitol Police to report several African American representatives engaged in the suspicious activity of voting against the bill."
1048,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that the situation had become untenable in recent days, aides working for Melania Trump released a statement Wednesday calling for the immediate removal of the first lady from the White House. According to the statement, the first lady “no longer deserves the honor” of serving in the position, which she has occupied since early 2017. The controversial memo went on to question the personal loyalty of the first lady to the president, going so far as to suggest she was someone widely viewed as “untrustworthy” within the administration. Noting that Melania Trump had repeatedly complained about the first lady to White House chief of staff John Kelly, sources painted a portrait of an East Wing in disarray and in desperate need of a shake-up. The unprecedented call for the ouster of a first lady by Ms. Trump has fueled speculation that she enjoys a great deal of influence over her husband. At press time, anonymous White House sources confirmed that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner had been meeting with possible first lady replacements for several months."

We’ve already collected 27 liters of plasma, and I pledge to use every last drop of it to renew my life force so that I can remain the top-ranking Democrat until 2075.” At press time, sources confirmed a newly spry Pelosi was on all fours frantically scrambling around the ceiling of the Capitol rotunda."
1050,"WASHINGTON—Challenging any insinuation that he would ever say anything of the kind, Representative Steve King (R-IA) vehemently denied Tuesday comparing immigrants to people. “I would never, under any circumstances, say something so despicable,” said King, who was recently elected to his ninth congressional term, adding that any accusations of him claiming migrants were human beings with rights, emotions, and cognitive development were completely false and crossed a line. “Everyone who knows me knows that I’ve never believed that immigrants are people, and any suggestion otherwise is utterly baseless. It makes me sick to think that the media is trying to smear me by spreading lies that I think any immigrant or refugee should be considered a person who in any way deserves basic respect or legal protections. Don’t you dare associate me with any monster who thinks that way.” At press time, King was vigorously denying claims that he had made the comment “I want to respect all people” by declaring there wasn’t a moral bone in his body."

That’s one possibility. The other is you give me $100 million. Up to you.” At press time, sources confirmed Clinton had raised $17.6 billion in the first 45 seconds of the campaign."
1052,"WASHINGTON—Praising them in a memorial ceremony for all the sacrifices they had made, President Donald Trump reportedly delivered a touching tribute Tuesday to the fallen heroes of WWE. “Let us never forget how WWE continues to affect all of us, and how these brave men dedicated their lives to wrestling for their country,” said Trump in a 15-minute speech that touched on the entire history of WWE, from the powerful rise of Vince McMahon to some of its most important conflicts, including the hard-fought battles of WrestleMania X, the brutal 2002 Survivor Series, and Hulk Hogan’s pivotal 1984 victory over the Iron Sheik. “As it became clear long ago that we as a nation would need to enter the WWE ring, when we needed them most, these heroes answered the bell. They endured chokeslams, flying elbows, and piledrivers, and many of them courageously laid the smackdown to protect the freedoms of this great nation.

1053,"TALAMANCAN MONTANE FORESTS, COSTA RICA—Venturing deep into rainforest no outsider has dared explore, President Trump slashed through the thick vines of a Central American jungle Monday in search of a previously unknown ethnic group to vilify. “Legend has it that this land is home to a lost race of people living in complete isolation, and if I can manage to find them, I will be able to stereotype them in any way I choose,” said the machete-wielding commander in chief who was wearing a tan field jacket as he led a group of loyal Republican allies through the oppressively hot and humid thicket in search of the mythic tribe. “This discovery could change everything. These people remain entirely untouched by any media coverage whatsoever, so I can easily stick them with the blame for our nation’s drug problems, violent crime, stagnant wage growth, you name it.” Upon sighting the uncontacted tribe, Trump’s reelection team reportedly took grainy black-and-white videos of them for immediate use in menacing campaign ads."
1054,"ATLANTA—As votes continued to be counted to determine the outcome of the controversial Georgia governor’s race, the state’s GOP officials reportedly demanded on Friday that Stacey Abrams step down as the Democratic candidate to avoid a conflict of interest. “It’s clear that the integrity of this important election will be violated if Ms. Abrams remains in her obviously biased post as the Democratic candidate for governor,” said Ryan Mahoney, aide to the Brian Kemp campaign, adding that Kemp had resigned as Georgia’s secretary of state two days after the election in order to avoid the appearance of partisanship and that it was only fair that Abrams recuse herself from her post as well. “Ms. Abrams already displayed her appalling bias by appearing on the ballot as a Democrat in the first place, but stepping down as the candidate now would still allow the election to be decided fairly. We urge her not to indulge in blatant partisan behavior by manipulating the system so that all the votes are counted, and to do the honorable thing by giving up her candidacy.” Georgia GOP officials added that residents could avoid abetting Abrams’ compromised position by not voting for her in a runoff election."
1055,"WASHINGTON—Laying on his horn while stuck in bumper-to-bumper gridlock, an annoyed special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly screamed at “dipshit protestors” from his car Thursday as a MoveOn rally held up traffic during his nightly commute. “Get a move on, assholes! Some of us have actual paying jobs and want to get home to our families after a long day at the office,” shouted the frustrated former FBI director, rolling down his window and berating the thousands of protestors to “shut the fuck up already” so he could “get out of this goddamn city.” “Seriously, don’t any of you people have jobs? It’s 5 p.m. on a Thursday. And hello? What happened to using sidewalks or speaking in a reasonable tone? Jesus, this shit should be illegal.” At press time, Mueller had reportedly been arrested for beating a protestor unconscious after the demonstrator kicked a dent into the side of his car."
1056,"WASHINGTON—Forcefully closing his eyes, grasping his head with both hands, and repeatedly screaming to be left alone, a visibly anguished President Donald Trump was observed Thursday banning the ghost of his late father, Fred Trump, from the press room for silently pointing at him. “You will not stare and raise your finger at me like that, Father! I am the president of the United States no matter what you think! I make the rules now, and you mustn’t defy me!” said Trump, raking his fingers down his face and straining his voice until it cracked as he pointed to an empty corner of the room and commanded a group of baffled aides to remove his long-dead father. “This is a disgrace—there is no place in the White House for your judgment—get him out of here! And someone silence the voices, the thousands of voices. I can barely talk with their whispers filling my head, their laughter and whispers. Father, this is my house! Stop pointing at me!” White House maintenance staff said it would take at least a week to clean the walls of the West Wing hallway where Trump had scrawled the words “GO AWAY” hundreds of times in what seemed to be red paint."
1057,"WASHINGTON—Expressing confusion as to why everyone was getting so worked up, special counsel Robert Mueller was reportedly wondering Thursday why there was all this drama over Donald Trump’s unpaid parking violations. “I mean, sure, he got some parking tickets, and he really should pay the fines, but it feels like people are freaking out for no reason,” said Mueller, acknowledging that while his investigation into the president had turned up multiple parking violations, including several times when the president had overstayed a parking meter and even a decades-old instance when he left his car in a handicapped zone, it was nothing to foment national mass protests against. “Obviously, it’s not ideal for a sitting president to have outstanding parking fines, but a lot of these are just BS street cleaning things, and honestly, he’s probably not even guilty of some of them. I don’t understand why he’s so resistant to talking to me about, what, maybe a few hundred bucks at most? Now his kids are being brought into it, and I even had to talk to his campaign manager just to make sure it was his vehicle. This whole thing is making a mountain out of a molehill.” Mueller added that he would be happy to cut the amount President Trump owes in half just to get the whole thing over with."
1058,"WASHINGTON—Responding to criticism that she had engaged in misleading behavior, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders issued a flat denial Thursday that she had shared doctored footage portraying CNN reporter Jim Acosta in clown makeup blowing up Gotham Hospital. “President Trump expects and even demands difficult questions from journalists, but for Acosta to infiltrate a hospital dressed as a nurse in order to plant explosives is simply beyond the pale,” said Sanders of the clip, which shows the White House correspondent standing outside pressing a remote detonator several times as a hospital explodes in the background. “This is clear evidence that Acosta has shirked his journalistic responsibility by murdering scores of Gotham citizens, and it’s even more outrageous given his track record of unhinged actions, including lighting a pile of money on fire with a cigar and robbing a bank at gunpoint with several masked accomplices. Banning Acosta from the press room is the only reasonable response for these clear lapses in judgment.” At press time, CNN had responded by holding a panel discussion featuring experts arguing over whether Sanders’ denial represented an effective strategy for the Trump administration."
1059,"AUSTIN, TX—Admitting that her attempts to fantasize about the victorious Senate candidate “just haven’t been the same,” noticeably flustered Beto O’Rourke voter Carissa Halpern told reporters Wednesday she was having difficulty refocusing her sexual yearnings onto Ted Cruz. “I was really hoping Beto would be my senator, but Ted Cruz won, so I guess I have to find a way to make this work,” said Halpern, adding that no matter how long she stared at photos of Cruz, she kept getting tripped up whenever she tried to imagine him in any of the steamy, intensely erotic scenarios his opponent had occupied in her desires over the past six months. “He doesn’t work out, he isn’t handsome, and he certainly doesn’t have an appealing personality or sense of humor. But he did manage to beat Beto at the polls, so maybe that’s kind of hot? I don’t know. Maybe if I picture him as being kind of like a sexy vampire? Oh God, no—no, that’s definitely not going to help. This is really going take a lot of work.” At press time, Halpern said that while she was still struggling to get off to Cruz, refocusing her sexual desires into fantasies involving torture and pain play was certainly helping."

1061,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to appeal to his base and build enthusiasm for his reelection bid, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that his 2020 campaign included plans to drive a specially decorated tour bus into crowds across the country. “I’ll have these amazing crowds, the biggest, most beautiful crowds you’ve ever seen, and we’ll just plow right through them in our bus,” said Trump, explaining his strategy for retaining control of the White House by energizing his base with campaign rallies and appearances and then crushing them under the weight of a chartered bus. “No one has campaigned like this before––bringing a gorgeous bus to huge crowds of everyday Americans and running them down. It’s the, you know, the people, and I’m the people’s president. It will probably say that on the bus. Important. Connect with voters. We’re going to the South, through the—what they call it since Obama—the rustbelt, meeting supporters, driving into them, driving over them. Driving over thousands of people. Men, women, children, everyday Americans, they’ll love it. They love buses. We get huge crowds of folks at my rallies, you know? These people, they’ll chant my name while I drive over them in our bus. Big bus, just beautiful. I’ll drive the bus myself—I can drive. The bus can go, like, 90 miles per hour, so we’ll—you know, I’m gonna do that. Run them over.

Pritzker was reportedly brainstorming new hobbies to blow his money on after winning the Illinois gubernatorial election. “Shelling out $171 million of my own money to get elected governor was fun and all, but now that that’s over and done with, it’s time to think big and find some other stuff I can buy,” said Pritzker, adding that after spending his own and his family’s vast wealth on starting an investment group with his brother, owning a horse farm in Wisconsin, purchasing a Lake Geneva vacation mansion, having a science center at the Milton Academy named after him, getting a building at the University of South Dakota named after his wife’s parents, ensuring the Northwestern law school was named after his family, setting up charities to provide cover for funneling money into offshore accounts, bankrolling union-busting activities at companies he owns, sending his children to private school, heavily funding two Hillary Clinton presidential campaigns, giving over $2 million to Duke University, flying on private jets, and winning the governor’s race, he was looking for a fun new diversion to help offload some more of his $3.4 billion fortune. “It’s definitely nice to be governor, but what I’m really looking for is something that requires me to pony up some serious moolah. After all, I only get to be governor of one state. I bought a bunch of Faberge eggs and a ton of the rarest luxury cars I could find, but that’s not really doing it for me. I was talking to someone the other day who said I could buy an Egyptian mummy, so maybe I’ll do that. Or I could buy up a bunch of vineyards, or a couple castles? Maybe I can use my time as governor to really get down to work on my dream of finally buying all of Da Vinci’s works. I’d better think of something soon, though, since all this cash is really burning a hole in my pocket.” At press time, Pritzker had decided to order a full-scale reproduction of Venice in southern Illinois after realizing how much taxpayer money he would have fritter away."
1063,"LAWRENCEVILLE, GA—Insisting that the machine was operating exactly as intended, Georgia election worker Mitchell Hamlin reportedly assured a black man on Tuesday that the ballot scanner was supposed to sound like a shredder. “Don’t you worry, it’s designed to sound like it’s ripping your ballot into thousands of tiny pieces,” the election worker informed the middle-aged African American resident, adding that it was merely a coincidence that several white voters in front of him had been directed to insert their ballots into a different scanner. “You should absolutely be hearing a constant whirring and shredding sound—that’s the machine’s way of telling you that your vote counts. And that bucket below where the ballot scanner is dropping strips of paper? That’s simply the machine producing a receipt so we know it went through to the right place. Congratulations, you definitely voted today.” At press time, Hamlin stated that he could also confirm the man’s registration for the 2020 election if he just handed over his driver’s license."
1064,"FORT WAYNE, IN—Growing increasingly frustrated as he attempted to cast his vote in the midterm elections despite a severe lack of clarity and transparency, citizen Geoff Barnes admitted Tuesday that he was deeply confused by an obscure down-ballot measure to determine the senator for his district. “I don’t even know who these people are or what this ‘senator’ thing is supposed to be, but I hate to just guess,” said Barnes, visibly annoyed at the ballot’s lack of any explanation as to what exactly the measure comprised and the absence of any kind of key that might help him comprehend the (R) and (D) symbols appearing next to the accompanying names. “I hate how they sneak these little things in at the end without giving you any information. Obviously, I know what I want done for the major issues, such as the dog park initiative and the new water reclamation substation, but who knows about this piddly stuff. Honestly, it’s things like this that keep people from voting altogether.” Barnes ultimately decided to register his displeasure by writing in the pseudonym “Joe Donnelly” instead."

I’m not really that familiar with the Wyoming governor’s race, and I have no idea which of these Michigan judges to vote for,” said McDonough, who said the two candidates to represent his North Carolina district in Congress were listed as being a Nebraska Republican and a New Hampshire Democrat. “I’m definitely voting yes on this ballot measure to legalize marijuana in North Dakota, but I’m not sure about approving a tax hike for this bridge in Mississippi. Maybe I’ll just play it safe and vote straight party-line for city council in Pittsburgh, Lubbock, and Anchorage.” At press time, a judge had upheld the legality of McDonough’s congressional district, which covers an acre-wide strip of land zig-zagging across the country."
1067,"HILLIARD, IA—Beginning to worry about his chances as he followed live Election Day media coverage, Libertarian Party House of Representatives candidate Maxwell Booth was reportedly concerned Tuesday after the latest polls showed him 98 points behind his competitors. “We knew it would be a tough race, but I have to admit, the final polls showing I’m dozens of percentage points behind the other candidates doesn’t fill me with a whole lot of confidence,” said Booth, who is running on the Libertarian Party ticket for the third consecutive election, stressing that polls showed him trailing his opponents by just 97 points as recently as last week. “This poll does have a four-point margin of error, so it’s entirely possible that I’m really receiving 4 percent or even 4.5 percent of the vote. It’s an uphill battle, of course, but who knows if those polls really capture the enthusiasm of voters out there, like the campaign sign of mine that one of my volunteers saw on someone’s lawn a few weeks ago. And if I can pull in .3 percent or even .4 percent of absentee ballots, I think we’re looking at really exceeding the pollsters’ expectations.” At press time, Booth and his three-person campaign staff were wondering if the election could tip their way after learning that early voting tallies had netted the candidate four votes."

And we made sure to be extra good these last couple weeks, because Santa is watching, and if you’re naughty he won’t count your votes.

Like, we see a bunch of different people, but then pick our primary guy.” Smith also wished for some manner of public forum in which candidates could discuss their ideals and goals in the presence of a moderator."

So, if someone could please just close down the polls until after the holidays, it would really be appreciated.” At press time, the nation added that it would even be fine to push midterms as far back as 2020 because they already knew the current sitting president was just going to get reelected anyways."

You’re presently struggling against your restraints, but there’s nothing you can do. Soon you will begin to black out from despair and pain. The last thing you see in your final moments is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer standing over you, laughing maniacally.” At press time, numerous Trump supporters had praised the ad for finally telling the truth about how they themselves had been killed by immigrants."

We are extremely disappointed that the secretary would use his office to enrich himself without also enriching the president.” White House officials added that while they were committed to investigating Zinke for potential impropriety, they wanted to reassure Americans that the vast majority of federal employees always followed protocol in giving a cut of the profits from their private-sector hustles to the president."

So far, our expectations have been wildly exceeded, and if these trends continue, we may be seeing suppression levels that haven’t been reached since the 1950s.” Mahoney also urged Republican voters in urban areas to assist the campaign by making a plan to intimidate their friends and neighbors this upcoming Tuesday."

These are voters who want to know: Is my instructor sick? Why is the gym full of folding tables? Am I going to be able to make my coffee mug next week?

Its provisions dictate that the president can sidestep any checks and balances on his power once he has abused his authority so many times that no one can keep track anymore.” Trump added that while his opponents may try to challenge his executive order in court, the loophole also states that by then he will have achieved his immediate political aims."

It is an absolute shame that the worldwide Jewish plot failed to telepathically communicate the imminent danger to the people in the building, or use their minds to erect an invisible, impenetrable barrier around the entire synagogue.” Trump ended his speech by calling for unity in the worldwide Jewish conspiracy to prevent future anti-Semitic hate crimes with their mystical powers."

1084,"SPRINGFIELD, IL—Saying he wished the former presidential candidate would “shut up and go away for once,” area man Justin Irsay told reporters Wednesday that he “just knows Hillary Clinton is going to have an opinion” on not dying in a pipe-bomb explosion. “Oh God, she’s going to be out there spouting some comments and making this all about her,” said Irsay, growing increasingly agitated as he imagined Clinton’s likely response to the homemade explosive device mailed to her home and addressed to her personally. “She can’t let anything go. The election was two years ago, for christsakes! It’s like, ‘Hey, Hillary—you lost. Can you get off my TV now?’ Jesus.” Irsay went on to state that dwelling on serial pipe bombings all the time would likely cost Democrats the 2020 election."
1085,"WASHINGTON—Following reports that incendiary devices had been sent to Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and George Soros, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer expressed relief Wednesday that he has never taken a stance meaningful enough to inspire someone to mail him an explosive. “Phew, this is where constantly equivocating and avoiding any issue that’s even remotely controversial really pays off,” said Schumer (D-NY), adding that he was thankful his persistent lack of political courage had all but guaranteed no one would ever be angry enough with him to “do something crazy or violent.” “I really dodged a bullet there! Hopefully if I just keep my head down and stay focused on tacitly supporting the status quo, I’ll keep out of the line of fire.” At press time, Schumer had issued a tepid statement urging Americans to consider all sides in the matter."

It’s just so irritating—48 hours later and my ears still haven’t stopped ringing.” At press time, the first lady was nowhere to be found after she reportedly looked into a mirror, saw a fiery portal open up behind her, and was sucked in with a deafening scream."

It’s crucial for us to carefully examine every word and phrase in order to determine whether the president is deliberately lying and using false information, or whether he simply misspoke or was taken out of context. By 2050, we expect to have fact-checked every one of President Trump’s public statements, interviews, state speeches, and extemporaneous remarks so that American voters can make an informed decision about the president’s relationship with the truth.” At press time, a new speech at a campaign rally by Trump had forced the fact-checkers to push back their deadline to 2075."

That’s a real bad dude, folks, and he’s just asking for it. We don’t want this kind of guy here at this rally, believe me. Six figures, seven figures—I don’t care how much. I’ll pay for it.

What makes you think you’ve done anything to earn that kind of treatment? I mean, if you really have your heart set on somebody who is well-liked and wants to work to bring all Texans together, then go ahead, vote for him. But that’s not what Texas stands for—at least not the Texans I represent.” The ad then closes with a close-up on the senator’s face and the appearance of a new slogan, “Ted Cruz: What Texas Has Coming To It.”"

Unfortunately, there was very little we could do before the fumes surrounding Mrs. Trump ignited and she burst into flames. Several staffers were severely impaired in the blast, and we had to make an emergency landing.” At press time, witnesses confirmed a crew of firefighters at the landing site was attempting to put out the still-burning first lady."

1097,"WASHINGTON—As criticism mounted over the country’s alleged role in the disappearance and possible death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the Trump administration reportedly urged the leaders of Saudi Arabia Friday to stick to killing random Yemeni civilians. “The potential murder of a high-profile journalist critical of their regime raises grave concerns for us, and we appeal to the leaders of Saudi Arabia to restrict their extrajudicial murders to Yemeni people who don’t have any public platform,” said President Trump, adding that the White House would not sit idly by as the Saudis caused the deaths of innocent people unless they were Yemeni children in a school bus or a group of Yemeni people attending a wedding. “The United States asks Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to content himself with killings that don’t affect business deals or call our diplomatic ties into question, such as airstrikes on Yemeni infrastructure, fueling mass cholera outbreaks, or blocking food and medical supplies from reaching civilians. Look, we don’t even mind if you dismember and murder people inside the Turkish consulate, as long as they’re unknown Yemenis whose deaths won’t cause an international scandal. For the sake of all parties, we demand that the Saudis only kill people who hardly anyone in America cares about.” At press time, several major U.S. newspapers had published editorials praising the Trump administration for its tough stance on Saudi Arabia."

I want to stay here with you. You’re going to protect me and make sure he doesn’t get me, right, Dad? He said he had enough proof to send me away to jail for a long, long time.

1099,"WASHINGTON—Urging Congress to take action before the entire system was compromised, the Federal Election Commission warned Thursday that many states were still relying on outdated methods to disenfranchise their voters. “The fact that a number of polling places across the country are still trying to purge voter rolls by hand is a huge issue,” said FEC spokesperson Angela Larson, noting that every state should have adopted fail-safe, digital disenfranchisement systems years ago. “We’ve had reports of officials manually throwing ballots in the garbage, and, frankly, that is completely absurd in 2018. The manpower something like this takes is ridiculous. Electronic voting machines should be getting hacked remotely to eliminate even the slightest possibility of a paper trail. Don’t even get me started with Georgia, where they’re still relying on draconian registration laws and inaccessible polling places to suppress the black vote the same way their parents and grandparents did.” At press time, Larson cautioned that many of these antiquated methods were rife for human error and could result in thousands of minorities being allowed to vote."
1100,"WASHINGTON—Logging countless hours in the Oval Office between warmly greeting foreign diplomats, an unusually serene and well-spoken President Trump was hard at work Thursday, industriously shepherding environmental and civil rights bills through Congress just days after a freak accident left a railroad spike lodged into his skull. “President Trump has been a model of professionalism ever since the accident—he’s attentive and inquisitive during intelligence briefings, articulate at press conferences, and his tweets have been increasingly vetted and thoroughly researched,” said White House chief of staff John Kelly, echoing the general sentiments of staffers in the West Wing, where feelings of general relief and a newfound sense of job security were observed during the two-hour morning meeting Trump convened to discuss naming Ada Limón the new U.S. poet laureate. “At first I was a bit concerned, as anyone would be when a railroad spike pierces a sitting president’s cerebral cortex and bisects his hypothalamus, but the White House physician checked him out and concluded that the benign effect on Trump’s disposition outweighs any possible long-term harm.” At press time, staffers confirmed Trump was growing morose and irritable after banging the protruding head of the spike on the doorframe of Air Force One while attempting to deplane."
1101,"WASHINGTON—Causing dread and consternation among significant swaths of registered voters, a series of Reuters-Ipsos polls released Tuesday increased fears that the 2018 midterm elections will be won by a wave of politicians. “Right now, many Americans are worried that the 2018 elections could be an absolute landslide for politicians, and everything we’re seeing seems to suggest that this is a very real cause for concern,” said McGill University political analyst Tasha Martin, warning that every predictor released by major polling organizations pointed to a “near-tsunami” of midterm gains for politicians and political figures, groups notorious for being selfish, out of touch with the general public, and corruptly bending to outside interests. “In fact, most predictions offer a nearly 100 percent chance that politicians will win both the House and Senate in November. For most Americans, seeing politicians completely in control of Congress might be enough to cause them to lose all faith in democracy.” Martin added that preliminary polling also raised the frightening specter of a politician taking the White House in 2020."
1102,"NEW YORK—Saying she hoped the new position would allow her to grow both personally and professionally, Nikki Haley announced Tuesday she would resign from her post as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in order to accept a consulting role with an Afghan warlord. “While I have greatly enjoyed my time in the Trump administration, this opportunity fits my skill set so well that I felt I couldn’t pass it up,” said Haley, adding that the job with a warlord she declined to name would permit her to continue in her career path while pursuing her passions for paramilitary operations, intimidation, propaganda, and torture. “I’m thrilled to begin this new adventure working alongside a true strongman, someone I have long admired for his ability to get things done. I believe the role I played at the U.N. has provided me with the experiences I need to help him consolidate his power and expand his reign of terror, putting him in a better position to take control of his war-torn homeland.” Haley went on to express her hope that with a little hard work, she could help her new employer become the next Butcher of Kabul."
1103,"RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA—Claiming that they could not have played a part in the disappearance, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman issued a statement Monday insisting that the exiled journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who went missing last week, had already been dismembered before he left the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “According to all reliable sources available at the embassy, Khashoggi’s armless and legless torso was seen leaving the consulate on Thursday,” read the statement, adding that this claim could be backed up by security camera footage showing the journalist’s severed right arm exiting a first-floor elevator earlier the same day, as well as several eyewitnesses who spotted chopped-up body parts hailing a taxi outside of the consulate that afternoon. “Though Khashoggi was a frequent critic of our regime, we can attest that his murder and dismemberment could not have been the work of the Saudi government. The timeline simply doesn’t match up. All we know is that the journalist was covered in blood and missing a lot of limbs when he arrived at the consulate on Tuesday and then left on Thursday—whatever happened to him after that remains a mystery to us. Really, we were stuck cleaning up after him. It was kind of rude to come in and leave a big mess everywhere.” At press time, the journalists reporting on this story had been dismembered."
1104,"WASHINGTON—Weighing the importance of the information against the potential political fallout, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) debated Friday whether or not now might be a prudent time to introduce into discussion the seven highly credible murder accusations against Brett Kavanaugh that were given to her in August. “Roughly five weeks ago, the family members of five slain women and two men presented me with dozens of file boxes full of concrete, corroborated evidence that Kavanaugh was personally and solely responsible for the deaths, and I’m now experiencing a strong feeling that maybe the other Senators, the media, and the American public should know,” said Feinstein, who also disclosed that dozens of people had come forward with information further connecting Kavanaugh to a string of brutal stranglings committed from 1986 to 2011, but had been turned away over concerns that it wasn’t relevant to the confirmation process. “His fingerprints are all over the crime scenes, there is DNA evidence from blood he left, and there are three dozen eyewitnesses. But information like that could really energize the Republican base, so you can see my dilemma here.” At press time, Feinstein had decided to sit on the evidence until a more politically expedient time."
1105,"WASHINGTON—Decrying the tactics as a smear campaign against an exemplary judge, Republicans blasted Brett Kavanaugh Friday for destroying the sterling reputation of a good man. “It’s despicable that this individual waited until the 11th hour to engage in offensive, partisan attacks in an attempt to discredit a decent and upstanding man,” said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), noting that Kavanaugh’s recriminations had repeatedly made a mockery of the entire confirmation process. “We’re talking about a devoted husband and father who was the top of his class at Yale and received accolades from the American Bar Association. And now his life has been destroyed by a completely non-credible individual bent on revenge. He has cast a cloud over this esteemed man and he should be deeply ashamed of the damage he has done to his family and the country as a whole.” Grassley added that he was confident the nomination of a morally upright man who had served his country for decades would not be derailed by the ravings of an inveterate liar like Kavanaugh."
1106,"WASHINGTON—Slowly coming to the realization that something was terribly wrong, President Trump reportedly awoke Friday to discover his entire body covered in dozens of small cuts after being chased through his dreams by a menacing Robert Mueller brandishing fingers covered in razor blades. “Oh, thank God. It was just a dream,” said Trump, just before seeing the very real, tiny wounds on his arms and chest that mirrored the lacerations he had received as the psychotic special prosecutor pursued him down the halls of the White House within his nightmare, laughing maniacally while he slashed violently at the president. “What—no. This isn’t possible. It was a dream! It was just a dream!” Trump later discovered that he was still asleep the moment Robert Mueller’s razor claws burst through the president’s mattress, dragging his struggling body down into its seemingly endless depths."
1107,"WASHINGTON—Stirring from his chloroform-induced stupor to discover a handwritten note shoved inside his pocket, Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL) reportedly awoke Thursday chained to a radiator with instructions to saw open his own stomach if he wished to access the FBI’s report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “You have 15 minutes to retrieve the document, read it, and get to the chamber to cast your vote,” said Durbin, who slowly became cognizant of the binder-shaped bulge pressing against the jagged stitches transecting his abdomen. “The vote is Saturday. If you ever want to know what’s inside that report, cut it out now. There will be no further instructions.” At press time, Durbin had gingerly drawn the rusty hacksaw provided by his captors across the first few inches of his distended gut before being interrupted by a groggy Senator Cory Booker emerging from a nearby bathtub."
1108,"CHAPPAQUA, NY—Brushing aside insinuations that she had anything to do with the rancorous confirmation process, former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton laughed off Wednesday the idea that she was politically savvy enough to run a revenge campaign against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “It’s utterly ridiculous to think that I, of all people, would have the political acumen to take down Judge Kavanaugh,” said Clinton, who pointed to her squandering what amounted to a sure bet to be elected president in 2016 as proof that she was far too inept to perpetrate the kind of elaborate political hit job on Kavanaugh that others had accused her of. “Come on, did you see the way I bungled all those allegations about my emails during the race? Or my totally pathetic efforts in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania? I haven’t even been able to shed false accusations of murder from 25 years ago. If I had tried to derail his confirmation, the whole scheme would have backfired and he’d be sitting on the Supreme Court by now.” Clinton also scoffed at the notion that she would have any impulse to do anything about the Supreme Court pick other than play up his right-wing views while soliciting donations from her base."

Sources confirmed that as the plane carrying the first lady moved across the sky high above the grasslands, herds of wildebeests were spotted stampeding directly into each other, their hoofbeats drowned out by the deafening sound of snapping bones, while a nearby pair of giraffes was seen ripping apart a screeching hyena. According to reports, the severed hyena then attempted to drown itself by dragging the top half of its body to a watering hole, which was thick with the blood of a dozen hippopotamuses that appeared to be eagerly devouring their own entrails. After the aircraft disappeared over the horizon, the hysteria reportedly ended and the savanna quickly returned to normal, with vultures descending upon the thousands of carcasses that lay rotting in the first lady’s wake."

It seemed like we established a great rapport. I mean, they must have been interested if they brought me back for a second interview, right? Hell, we even delved into some personal stuff from high school, so that’s a good sign,” said Kavanaugh, who had, in a state of panic, reached out to his list of personal references to see if they had been contacted in regards to his candidacy. “Shit, I really want this job. They didn’t mention interviewing anyone else for the position, but maybe they were? I feel like I asked them some pretty decent questions, too. And I mentioned I went to Yale. Fuck, what if I forgot to bring that up?” At press time, Kavanaugh was nervously rewording a follow-up email so that he didn’t come off as too desperate."

At the time of the exchange, President Trump was very frustrated and exhausted with how utterly pathetic the reporter’s question was, so he unfortunately let slip fewer barbs about her physical appearance and intellectual capabilities than he would have otherwise.” At press time, the record had been corrected once more to deny the existence of any previous version of the transcript."
1113,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to undermine the credibility of the woman who testified that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school, Senator Chuck Grassley reportedly scratched “Christine Blasey’s a slut” into a Senate bathroom stall Monday.

At press time, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Senator Jeff Flake (R-AZ) had led FBI investigators into the bathroom to show them the message, saying it offered conclusive evidence that Dr. Blasey Ford’s accusations were entirely baseless and that she clearly had no integrity whatsoever."

Seriously, at most, I thought I’d have to have lunch with people doing stuff with the oil pipelines.” Susan Collins (R-ME) concurred with Murkowski, saying she once thought her job as the senator for Maine would mainly entail dealing with, like, lobsters and maple fucking syrup."
1116,"BETHANY BEACH, DE—Shaking his head in frustration as he read about the testimony given by his old high school friend to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mark Judge reportedly confirmed Friday that he couldn’t believe that fucking lightweight Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh got the meanings of “boofing” and “the Devil’s Triangle” wrong. “Seriously, that’s just fucking despicable, and there’s no way that little bitch should be anywhere near the Supreme Court,” said a visibly pissed-off Judge, adding that he couldn’t fathom handing over a lifetime appointment to America’s highest judicial body to “some candy-ass dipshit” who couldn’t remember important things like the fact that everyone knows the Devil’s Triangle “is not some dumb drinking game—it’s a fuckin’ threesome with two dudes on one chick. It’s awesome.” “Jesus Christ, I’ve never been so disappointed in someone. I mean, I knew Brett was a puker, but I simply can’t accept the possibility that he blacked out from drinking ’skis so many times that he forgot that boofing is taking beer up the ass. He said it’s about farting? Come the fuck on, dude—we used to boof all the time! Man, all of America was watching, and he totally pussied out. Honestly, I’m ashamed to say I was his friend.”Judge added that he hoped that further investigations into Kavanaugh could allow the nominee to prove his truthfulness by vouching for the time they were in a threesome at a party and their dicks accidentally touched."
1117,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Admitting that it would be a nice change of pace to have some attention every now and then, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told reporters Friday that he sometimes wished he could be accosted by protesters as he ate his usual meal alone at his local Applebee’s. “I’m not asking for a crowd, but I wouldn’t mind a few people stopping by to yell at me or hurl some sort of accusations just so I wouldn’t have to eat by myself,” said Senator Graham, who also remarked on how “lucky” Texas senator Ted Cruz had been to be chased from a restaurant over his support of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. “I mean, I eat at least four meals a week in this Applebee’s, and I’m a staunch Kavanaugh supporter who has said a lot of frankly terrible things to discredit his accusers, so why don’t the regulars here try and drive me away? Hell, they don’t even have to ruin my whole meal. Just a quick ‘fuck you’ as they walked by would make me feel like I was noticed.” Senator Graham later became defensive when a stranger walked toward him while saying, “Hey, you,” but almost immediately realized the man had been addressing someone behind him."
1118,"WASHINGTON—Admitting he was surprised by all the tasks required of him in order to enter the prestigious organization, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh reportedly stated Thursday that he was impressed by the hazing rituals you have to go through before they let you join the Supreme Court. “Man, I knew the Supreme Court doesn’t let just anyone in, but I’ve got to say, they’ve really made me run the gauntlet and do all this embarrassing stuff—I mean, I had to go on national television with my wife and tell everyone how long I was a virgin,” said Kavanaugh, acknowledging that he had to respect the humiliating challenges he’s been put through to prove himself worthy of the Supreme Court, like showing his high school diary to the entire country and having to face multiple women from his youth who he “didn’t even go all the way with.” “I did some pretty gnarly stuff back during my fraternity days, so I figured they’d force me to get paddled or chant the Supreme Court motto ‘Equal Justice Under Law’ for a few hours outside in my underwear or stick my thumb up someone’s ass, but this hazing is really putting me through a wringer. But I’ll do whatever I have to if it means they’ll let me be a justice. Supreme Court for life!” Kavanaugh added that when he had felt especially ashamed during the hazing process, he just reminded himself that this was the same initiation his future Supreme Court brother Clarence Thomas had to endure."
1119,"WASHINGTON—Speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Brett Kavanaugh defended himself against accusations of misconduct Thursday with claims that he never committed sexual assault as it will come to be defined in a future Supreme Court case. “The allegations that I assaulted these women are categorically untrue based on the 2019 case ofSandberg v. Jones, which will establish that only penetrative sex can be classified as assault, and then only in cases with up to four eye-witnesses,” said Kavanaugh, arguing that the upcoming 5-4 decision in which he will write the majority opinion would completely exonerate him. “Admittedly, there are things from my past that cause me to cringe, but I have never done anything that could be considered illegal based on this landmark ruling that will come up in the next few months. Furthermore, these accusations are largely irrelevant as they fall significantly outside the soon-to-be-established statute of limitations of two weeks following an alleged incident.” Kavanaugh added that this whole ordeal had been extremely trying for him and his family, and he looked forward to pursuing legal action against Christine Blasey Ford for violating forthcoming laws against defaming a federal judge."
1120,"WASHINGTON—Claiming that her refusal to appear before them and testify called into question all of her accusations, GOP officials attacked Brett Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford for never coming forward during Thursday’s public hearing. “Dr. Ford was extremely disrespectful by refusing to show up today. We set up this hearing and sat there for hours waiting, yet we didn’t hear a single word from her,” said Senator Chuck Grassley, who claimed the Senate now had no choice but to move forward on the confirmation vote since Ford had outright refused to publicly defend her allegations or even enter the Capitol Building. “Her absence clearly discredits her entire story. Brett Kavanaugh was brave enough to show up, he spoke very clearly and eloquently, and everyone here carefully listened to what he had to say. My colleagues sacrificed their time and energy to prepare a number of important questions and waited around, but we just got crickets.” Grassley added that it was completely unprofessional for his Democratic colleagues Dianne Feinstein, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar, and Mazie Hirono to skip the hearing as well."
1121,"WASHINGTON—Suddenly rethinking his selection amid an already tumultuous confirmation process, President Donald Trump told reporters Wednesday he regrets choosing Brett Kavanaugh after hearing the Supreme Court nominee talk extensively about the high regard in which he holds women. “Whoa, hang on—when I nominated him, I thought it was pretty clear where he stood with the opposite sex, but now he’s on TV going on and on about how all women are entitled to dignity and respect,” said the president, explaining that while he was on board with Kavanaugh’s decision to deny all accusations of sexual assault, he began to have second thoughts after hearing his nominee describe a lifelong record of promoting equality for women. “I’m thinking, Is this really the type of guy I want on the highest court in the land? I’d be fine if he were just going around talking about how much he values women who are beautiful, but he shouldn’t be saying all this other stuff. What if it affects the way he rules? I should probably just withdraw the nomination before people start questioning my judgment.” At press time, sources reported President Trump had placed a frantic phone call to U.S. circuit judge Amy Barrett, saying her views on women could definitely be trusted."
1122,"WASHINGTON—Growing increasingly confused as he slowly adjusted to his surroundings, Brett Kavanaugh was reportedly shocked Wednesday to find out he’s a Supreme Court nominee after sobering up from a 35-year drunken bender. “Oh, Christ, what the hell happened last night? What am I doing here?” said the yet-unconfirmed nominee, fighting waves of nausea and massaging his throbbing temples as he attempted to piece together not only how he safely made it home after completely blacking out, but also the series of events that resulted in him graduating from Yale, embarking on a career in law, getting married, buying a house, and starting a family. “The last thing I remember was that I was about to nail that hot shooting guard from the women’s basketball team, and then everything gets kind of hazy. Holy shit, wait—I worked for the Bush administration? I didn’t even know there was a Bush presidency. And apparently Donald Trump is president now, whoever that is. I know I sometimes do crazy shit when I’m fucked up, but this is another level. Jesus—that’s the last time I do shots of Jager.” At press time, Kavanaugh was reportedly attempting to quickly sober up by eating a 17-year-old slice of pizza he had found on the floor of his bedroom."
1123,"WASHINGTON—After brutally launching the head of the special counsel investigation into Russian election interference through every marble pillar of the Jefferson Memorial, the nefarious shadow special counsel held Robert Mueller by the throat at the top of the Washington monument Wednesday and hissed that “Your investigation ends now.” “You’ve followed your little trail long enough, you paltry, pathetic patriot,” said dark Mueller, his viselike grip tightening on the neck of the attorney and former FBI director as he inexorably forced the special counsel’s face down toward the monument’s razor-sharp electrum-plated pyramidal tip. “Your time is up! The president will be exonerated! Any final questions?” Eyewitnesses fleeing the scene reported having no idea as to how the conflict ended, as their view was obstructed when Mueller countered the shadow counsel’s onslaught by launching both himself and his foul doppelganger off the top of the monument, causing them to plummet the full 554 feet to the bottom of the reflecting pool, which emptied itself thunderously as all its water leapt skyward in the cataclysmic shock wave."
1124,"WASHINGTON—Saying the continued attention from his former flame was beginning to border on obsession, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh told reporters Tuesday it’s super embarrassing and sad that Christine Blasey Ford is still in love with him. “It’s just so awkward that she keeps holding a candle for me even though it’s been, like, 35 years now,” said Kavanaugh, explaining that while he and Ford may have shared a romantic moment as teenagers, it’s “kind of pathetic” that she continues to dwell on it. “In a way, I’m flattered, I really am, but at this point it’s starting to get a little creepy. I hear she’s even telling her therapist about me. Apparently, some people just never move on from high school. It’s like, come on, Christine­—it’s not going to happen, okay? Sorry.” Later, the visibly distressed nominee expressed his hope that there weren’t too many other loves from his past out there who have yet to get over him."
1125,"NEW YORK—Shaking their heads in disbelief at their past views, everyone present at the United Nations summit watching President Donald Trump deliver a speech Tuesday reportedly couldn’t believe they used to consider the United States a superpower. “I mean, wow, we would base most of our decisions on what the U.S. was going to do—seriously, what the hell were we thinking?” said Prime Minister of Portugal António Costa, echoing the sentiments of dozens of other world leaders attending the General Assembly session who wondered how they had ever convinced themselves that they should care what America thinks. “We really used to see the U.S. as one of, if not the dominant force in the world, but that seems like forever ago. There are probably 20 or 30 countries whose plans I’d pay attention to before I even thought to consider how America would react. Seriously, imagine being concerned over how your diplomatic relations with Donald Trump are going—it feels totally beside the point, right? Although, jeez, if I’m being honest, maybe ever considering America to be a global superpower in the first place was misguided.” At press time, Trump casually threatening to unilaterally bomb multiple other countries with little justification reminded everyone at the U.N. that this was the reason everyone had to take America seriously."
1126,"WASHINGTON—Baffled as to how the potentially disastrous mistake could have gone unnoticed for so many years, White House sources confirmed Friday that roughly 417,225 hours of private presidential conversations were discovered immaculately preserved due to the fact that no one remembered to turn off Richard Nixon’s tape recorder. “Uh oh—it turns out that every single word that has been uttered in the Oval Office since the early 1970s has been perfectly recorded on this hidden device. This could be pretty bad,” said a Trump administration official who wished to remain anonymous, revealing that aides had stumbled upon the tapes earlier this week and, after discovering they contained thousands of clearly recorded conversations over the course of the Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, and Trump presidencies, had been unsure how to proceed in handling a find of such magnitude. “I’m not sure the American public could handle some of the information these tapes contain. There’s key information that could clarify the Iran–Contra scandal, countless conversations about the war in Iraq—there’s even a meeting where George W. Bush and Dick Cheney discuss 9/11 almost a month before it happened. This is going to have huge repercussions.” At press time, sources reported that the panicked aides had, in a botched attempt to delete the recording, accidentally begun to play on a loop the audio of a 1981 Oval Office meeting in which Vice President George H.W. Bush hires John Hinckley Jr. to assassinate president Ronald Reagan."
1127,"WASHINGTON—Questioning the actions taken by Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s following the alleged sexual abuse bySupreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while they were in high school, President Donald Trump reportedly asked Friday why she didn’t just immediately request hush money. “If this thing actually happened, why didn’t she come forward 30 years ago with a demand for secret payments to keep quiet?” said Trump, adding that a decades-old allegation of sexual abuse that wasn’t instantly followed by her threatening to go public unless Kavanaugh and his family paid her off totally lacked credibility. “If the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says, surely she has a copy of the demands she sent to Brett Kavanaugh or bank documents showing the transfer of a six-figure sum into her account during the ’80s that she could show us. It’s baffling—if he really did something illegal, why didn’t she just demand money for her role in covering up the crime? That’s what any normal person would do.” The president acknowledged that he could see how someone might have difficulty remembering the exact details of their involvement in a six-figure hush money payment made back in the 1980s."
1128,"WASHINGTON—Emphasizing that they really want to help any way they can, members of Congress announced Friday that while they desperately wish they could lend aid and assistance to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico while it struggles to recover from Hurricane Maria, the fact remains that the island is all the way over there. “It should go without saying that our hearts go out to the residents of Puerto Rico in this hour of need, and we want nothing more than to help its citizens, but they live way, way off in the sticks,” said Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI), stressing that Puerto Rico is not connected to the mainland by either bridges or tunnels, and when you look at a map you can plainly see it is all the way out in the Caribbean. “Let’s be clear—we all feel that it would be fantastic to provide these people post-disaster assistance, but have you ever been to that part of the world? It’s pretty much halfway around the globe. Any doctors, engineers, or infrastructure technicians we sent would be, like, ‘Ugh, how long does it take to go the whole way to Puerto Rico?’ after just a few hours, trust me.” Congress has also released a non-binding resolution officially declaring that by the time any U.S. aid reached Puerto Rican residents, they probably would have the hurricane damage all fixed anyway."
1129,"WASHINGTON—Urging a return to civility amid a contentious confirmation fight, GOP officials called Thursday for calmer, more reasonable death threats to be made toward Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser. “We understand there’s a lot of controversy around this, but she still deserves to have people threaten to kill her in a polite way,” said Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who added that cooler heads must prevail, especially when dealing with a situation as delicate as taunting the accuser by vowing to broadcast her family’s home address. “It’s important for us to maintain a sense of decorum. Now, that doesn’t mean we have to stop sending graphic emails—it just means we should tone down the rhetoric about mutilating her corpse. You should always take the high road and leave her children out of this. Remember, there’s really no need to use misogynistic slurs such as ‘bitch’ when ‘lying whore’ will suffice.” At press time, Grassley reiterated that a “true conservative” would terrorize her in a way that would “make our founding fathers proud.”"
1130,"WASHINGTON—Vehemently defending the Supreme Court nominee against recent allegations of sexual assault, GOP officials declared Wednesday that Brett Kavanaugh shouldn’t be held accountable for something he did as a white teenager. “We’re talking about something that occurred when Mr. Kavanaugh was a mere 17-year-old Caucasian,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), adding that it was ridiculous to allow a single incident that happened when Kavanaugh was in an elite and mostly white high school ruin the career of such an accomplished white person. “I expect most of my colleagues here in the Senate remember what it’s like to be a young white man and make mistakes. The important thing is that we learn from those mistakes and grow up to be responsible white adults. It’s shameful that my Democratic colleagues feel the need to sully Judge Kavanaugh’s reputation when they, too, surely understand that boys of European descent will be boys of European descent.” McConnell went on to state that the assault would hardly even be noteworthy had the victim not been a 15-year-old white girl."
1131,"WASHINGTON—While using brightly colored magic markers to write articles in a makeshift bullpen deep beneath the White House, an ink-splattered Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. said Wednesday they had made it their mission to fight bias in the mainstream media by hand-printing their own newspaper. According to the brothers, the inaugural issue of their paper, calledThe Trump Boy Times, covers the most pressing issues of the day, with front-page stories such as “The Time Dad Saved The Country In Porko Reeco From A Hurricane” and “Dad Again Tops List Of 100 Best American Pretzeldents.” Though fingerprints and smudges rendered much of the text unreadable, the content inside the paper appeared to include obituaries of “dumb Democrats” the boys wished were dead and a comic strip depicting the misadventures of a character called Little Eric. “When we heard the stuff those mean news jerks were talking about, we knew we had to find a way to get a whole bunch of the actual truth out there,” said Eric Trump, who held up a copy of the issue to show how hard he had worked to decorate its construction-paper pages with stickers and glitter, continuing on with the project even after a misapplication of rubber cement resulted in his hand being stuck to a table for more than an hour. “Unlike those lying germalists [sic], when we make up the news, we don’t use any bias. We are doing lotsa good work.” “After all, President Dad is counting on us!” Eric added. Reports within the executive residence confirmed the Trump boys were going through two packs of candy cigarettes a day as they sat in an unused closet illuminated only by their Vtech Spin and Learn Color Flashlight, transcribing notes they had written on their hands during a “top-secret meeting” with Ben Carson. White House sources confirmed the brothers cornered the Housing and Urban Development secretary in the West Wing and peppered Carson with questions about how much bigger and louder America’s bombs were than North Korea’s. With the first issue’s publication fast approaching, sources said production had come to a screeching halt early Tuesday, when Don Jr. yelled, “Stop the presses!” after Eric hit him on the arm for saying the younger brother wasn’t old enough to be the newspaper’s editor. The boys then reportedly began wrestling as they argued over whether to lead the edition with the story about their dad being the number-one president of all time or an exclusive headlined “No Moore Choccccolate Milk In White Howse Cafurteria.” The tense editorial meeting reportedly came to an abrupt conclusion once Eric started crying after being placed into a headlock. Later, while toutingThe Trump Boy Timesas “the only place to get the real story that probably happened,” Don Jr. and Eric were seen distributing the half dozen handmade copies they had finally produced to the first people they encountered in the halls of the White House, including a Secret Service agent, two West Wing interns, Melania Trump, and a butler who brought them a snack after they complained about running out of graham crackers. Deeming their project a success, the brothers were soon overheard planning the launch of a Trump Boys TV news channel, and after climbing inside a large cardboard box with a hole cut out of the front, they spent much of the afternoon interviewing their favorite action figures and asking them why people spread so many lies about their dad. “Now that we’re on the beat, there will finally be a paper that runsrealnews about Dad,” Don Jr. said while taking a break from penning a statement from the newspaper’s editorial board urging the president to let his sons stay up until 8:30 p.m. and eat ice cream. “It’s been super tough trying to get the story. Sometimes you have to camp out underneath the Resolute desk for a whole hour, and sometimes Eric has to keep going to the press briefings every day even though Sarah Sanders never calls on him. But no matter what, we always get the scoop.” “I bet we’ll get a Publisher’s Surprise [sic] for this,” he added. At press time, sources reported President Trump was throwing a wadded-up newspaper at the boys and telling them to get out of his office."
1132,"DALLAS—In an effort to make himself more appealing to voters, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) reportedly tried to connect with the audience at a candidate forum Tuesday by wearing the bloody, skinned face of a far more handsome man as a mask. “People are really responding to this new, dapper Ted Cruz,” said campaign manager Jeff Roe, noting that recent internal polls show that since Cruz adopted the new look, voters are twice as likely to describe the expressionless, gore-covered incumbent as “trustworthy,” “affable,” or “charming.” “That rough-cut mask of rotting skin is doing wonders for the senator on the campaign trail. He’s honestly never looked better, and the voters are really beginning to take notice. Even with the stench of decomposition, most people we talk to remark upon how Sen. Cruz doesn’t make them feel as nauseous as he used to. He’s looking a lot healthier, too.” Roe later confirmed that while Cruz’s current mask was rapidly decaying, the candidate had a freezer filled with enough handsome and blood-encrusted masks of human skin to last him through the campaign’s final stretch."
1133,"WASHINGTON—In a stark reversal of earlier immigration policy, President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that his administration was increasing the number of asylum seekers allowed to enter the United States’ spike-filled refugee compactor. “We feel strongly that 15 million people fleeing abuses in their own countries can be accommodated by our great nation’s fiery, spike-covered compactor,” said Trump, noting that this number represented the highest cap on asylum seekers since the hydraulically powered displaced-person-reducer was first created in 1980. “We are proud to welcome those without a home into our state-of-the-art refugee pulverizer where they will be greeted by rows and rows of razor-sharp spears lacerating their flesh as the walls slowly close in around them before ultimately being reduced to ashes by 450-degree flames. Every refugee, no matter their circumstances, deserves the chance to be admitted into this harrowing gauntlet of torture and death.” Trump added that emigrants from countries impacted by the travel ban would still be forced to return to their respective home countries’ citizen crushers."
1134,"WASHINGTON—Proclaiming that the government’s rescue efforts have brought several U.S. citizens into the world, the White House announced Monday that the official Hurricane Florence death toll had been raised to -17. “Thanks to President Trump’s incredible hurricane response team, the population of North and South Carolina is actually skyrocketing, with over a dozen people being born, spontaneously generating, or being resurrected,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that despite 90-mph winds and 7-foot flood zones, FEMA and the National Guard had found several newborns, clones, and reincarnated individuals nearly every hour on the hour. “Not only have zero American citizens died during this record-breaking storm, but over the past few days alone, workers have also located a number of missing people, including many Puerto Ricans who were declared missing or dead during Hurricane Maria. As the storm continues to move up the coast, we can only pray that many, many more Americans are created in the wreckage.” At press time, Sanders emphasized that President Obama had never once bothered to spontaneously generate life during his presidency, let alone during a Category 1 hurricane."
1135,"WASHINGTON—Following Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her at a high school party, sources close to Brett M. Kavanaugh told reporters Monday that the nominee was “sweating bullets” due to betting his entire life savings on his confirmation to the Supreme Court. “Oh, shit, it was a sure thing. I was so confident I cashed in my 401(k), borrowed $65,000 on top of my mortgage, and shoved my daughters’ college funds in the pot. I can’t have it go south now,” said Kavanaugh while texting his bookie on his burner phone, insisting that the Senate vote would go exactly to plan and that caving in his kneecaps wouldn’t be necessary. “If I don’t get a few more days to make sure these Republican senators don’t flip, Vito’s going to feed me to the pigs. That guy does not fuck around.” Kavanaugh’s office would not confirm reports that he had been seen haphazardly throwing all his belongings into a briefcase after Dr. Blasey Ford volunteered to testify before Congress."
1136,"WASHINGTON—In the wake of the release of a letter implicating the Supreme Court nominee in a sexual assault, Senate Republicans told reporters Monday that they would seek to delay a vote on Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation until his accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, was properly smeared. “Given the significance of this vote and the accusations at hand, it’s of the utmost importance that we give ourselves the time to carefully drag Miss Ford’s name through the mud and make her regret ever coming forth with these accounts,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), stressing that he would urge his colleagues to push back any vote on the nomination until the Senate Judiciary Committee had taken every opportunity to tear apart Ford’s character on a national stage, question her mental stability, and repeatedly trivialize her experience of sexual trauma. “We can’t in good conscience confirm Judge Kavanaugh—to the highest court in the land, mind you—without making a serious attempt to find evidence from the accuser’s life suggesting she’s nothing more than a serial liar and attention seeker. If not just to slander her name, than at least to invalidate the experiences of every sexual assault victim in the country.” McConnell stressed that he understood the need for swiftness in the matter, as the Senate would absolutely confirm Kavanaugh regardless of any findings."
1137,"WICHITA, KS—Expressing their displeasure that the Supreme Court nominee had failed to warn them about a factor that could harm his candidacy, the Koch brothers were reportedly furious Monday that Brett Kavanaugh never disclosed that the nation might care about sexual abuse. “When we agreed to spend millions of dollars toward his confirmation, we never believed Kavanaugh would’ve withheld important information from us like the fact that being a sexual predator could someday have consequences,” said an angry Charles Koch, adding that his advocacy group, Americans for Prosperity, would not have committed money to supporting Kavanaugh if he had come clean about the recent shift in America’s societal conscience that held some men credibly accused of sexual misconduct accountable for their actions. “Look, we’ve been building up Kavanaugh’s resume and qualifications for decades, and not once did he make any sort of suggestion that committing a nonconsensual sexual act on another person could be a problem in the United States. We would have never put him on our shortlist for the nation’s highest court if we knew the American people would ever pay attention to this or that it could have any adverse effect.” The Koch brothers added that they were already putting a more strenuous vetting process into place, stating that they were now asking candidates if the nation would ever care about racism."
1138,"WASHINGTON—Deeply troubled by the communication received from a divine messenger, Mike Pence was reportedly struggling Friday to reckon with a recent vision of the Prophet Muhammad revealing that the vice president was destined to become the next president of the United States. “He told me that I was the chosen one and I’m the one true president, but also it was the wrong guy speaking on God’s behalf. I’m not a huge supporter of Islam, but on the other hand, I really liked what Muhammad was saying. Hmm, this is a toughie,” said the vice president, attempting to weigh his desire for political power against his strict commitment to Evangelical Christianity, which were seemingly unable to coexist in the vision of the future brought forth by the sacred prophet and founder of Islam. “Maybe it was just Jesus disguised as the prophet Muhammad and he was trying to test my faith. But then, does that mean it’s not my fate to be president? I guess I could convert to Islam for a few days just to claim my destiny and then convert right back to Christianity. I mean, Islam and Christianity are actually kind of similar when you think about it, right?” At press time, Pence had decided to split the difference between the two religions and converted to Judaism."
1139,"Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court seat vacated by Anthony Kennedy, generated a firestorm of controversy from the moment his nomination was announced and throughout his Senate Judiciary Committee hearings last week.The Onionpresents the case for and against confirming Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court. Will interpret the law using framers’ original intent of unlimited executive power. Made it through entire hearing without perjuring himself more than a couple times. Would deal significant blow to Cory Booker’s 2020 presidential chances. Told Senator Harris he didn’t discuss the Mueller investigation with anyone, so it’s nice he’s not a gossip. Served as White House staff secretary under Resistance hero George W. Bush. Would give next several decades of activists lots to work with. Last thing we need is another dirty Catholic on the bench. The country’s complicated labyrinth women must navigate to get an abortion is fine just the way it is. Attended Yale. Favorite Supreme Court case is the hacky, clichedBiddle v. Perovich. Would offer fun challenge to conservative donors to find someone even worse. Staunch version of originalism doesn’t take into consideration that those things happened 250 years ago and most people were really fucking stupid back then."
1140,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the president was minimizing the contributions of his predecessor while making hyperbolic claims about his administration’s own input, experts reportedly criticized President Trump Tuesday for unfairly claiming credit for the rise in economic inequality that occurred under President Obama’s watch. “While Trump is right that economic inequality is increasing under him, he cannot ignore the Obama administration’s significant contributions to the current wealth gap,” said Brookings Institution senior analyst Gregory Chen, adding that any overview of rising economic inequality must also consider other factors deserving credit, such as banks, technology companies, and other corporations that routinely broke laws and engaged in predatory practices, over which any president has little control. “President Trump needs to face the fact that he is simply not solely responsible for the further enrichment of corporate executives and for making millions of Americans’ lives more financially precarious—President Obama made great strides in those areas over his eight years as president. Credit where credit is due. However, if Trump’s massive tax reforms continue transferring money to the ultra-wealthy, we could certainly see a time in the future where Trump’s contributions to economic inequality override Obama’s legacy and truly help American households in the top 1 percent.” At press time, critics also slammed Trump for taking credit for many of the part-time jobs with no benefits and zero job security added to the U.S. economy for which Obama is actually responsible."
1141,"WASHINGTON—Promising that the author would spend “100 kajillion years in jail,” Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. told reporters Tuesday that they had left a $5 bill and a Snickers bar under a propped-up laundry basket in order to trap the anonymous writer of the New York Times op-ed piece. “Everyone is super mad about this secret bad guy in the White House, but we put a whole candy bar and a bunch of real money in there, and we’re gonna catch the crook,” said Donald Trump Jr., who, along with his younger brother, was crouched behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office to monitor their trap and pull the rope once the “buttless [sic]” opinion-piece writer climbed under the plastic tub to grab the candy. “I’ve got a Super Soaker and Eric has a broom so we can arrest him once he gets stuck. We also dug a pretty deep hole in the backyard and covered it with a blanket and some pieces of grass on top. It has our Iron Man action figure and some Skittles and some of Dad’s Pop Secret [sic] work stuff on it to trick him to walk over and then fall down and never, ever get out unless we say so. Then, we’ll bring him to the police and prove you don’t mess with the Trumps.” At press time, Eric Trump was reportedly bawling after getting trapped under the laundry basket while trying to grab the Snickers bar."
1142,"ANAHEIM, CA—In a fiery speech delivered to students at the Anaheim Convention Center over the weekend, former President Barack Obama reportedly urged young voters to get out there and ignore how many lousy candidates the Democratic Party runs. “We’re experiencing a crisis in our democracy that can only be stopped by showing up to vote for people who will fight for transformative change, but until we start offering that, please just go to your polling place and cast your vote for whichever mediocre Democrat is on the ballot,” said Obama, pressing young people to avoid thinking about the actual track records and ideological beliefs of Democratic Party politicians who have been in government for years and just concentrating on the (D) next to their name. “We have too many eligible voters who are staying home on Election Day instead of standing up to the Republican Party by voting for Democrats who are in many respects exactly like their Republican opponents. Less than one in five young Americans voted in the 2014 midterms because our party ran very few good candidates, and we implore you to go out and vote this time even though we’re doing that again. What’s important for the future of America is that you just close your eyes, don’t think about it too hard, and select that name.” At press time, Obama urged the young generation of voters to stand up and save the U.S. democracy, since his generation of Democratic politicians was not capable of such a feat."
1143,"WASHINGTON—Assuming the subject would have at least been raised once during the past three days of confirmation hearings, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh confirmed Thursday that he was surprised not one senator had questioned him about the fact that he never went to law school. “Honestly, I’m kind of shocked that these senators didn’t rake me over the coals for not having a law degree,” said Kavanaugh, noting that while he took a few political science classes in college and read SCOTUSBlog from time to time, he was really more of a legal hobbyist. “I’m happy to share my opinion on abortion and stuff, but, again, that isn’t grounded in any kind of legal background, per se. In fact, I actually majored in sports medicine.” Kavanaugh went on to note that despite not knowing exactly how the Supreme Court functioned, he was sure he would pick up on most of the U.S. judicial system’s quirks after a few weeks on the job."
1144,"WASHINGTON—Admitting that he regretted his answer as soon as it came out of his mouth, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was reportedly panicking Wednesday after botching the part of his confirmation where he was asked if he rejects Satan. “Shit, I was supposed to say ‘yes,’” said Kavanaugh, who, when asked by the Senate Judiciary Committee if he renounced the devil and all his work and empty promises, delivered an emphatic “no,” which was then met with loud gasps from all those present. “Oh, man, I can’t believe I fucked this up and sided with the Prince of Darkness—I was doing so well up until then! I knew I should have rehearsed the whole ‘rejecting Satan’ question a few more times. Maybe I can ask for a do-over on that one.” At press time, several eyewitnesses spotted a visibly nervous Kavanaugh writing “Satan = Bad, God = Good” on his hand before heading back into the Senate chamber."
1145,"WASHINGTON—Expressing his gratitude that the president was a big enough dipshit to be this easily placated, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly was reportedly relieved Wednesday that Donald Trump was so fucking stupid that he believed Bob Woodward had fabricated disparaging quotes from staffers in his upcoming book,Fear. “I was sweating bullets for a minute there when the president called me into his office for referring to him as ‘unhinged’ and ‘an idiot,’ but luckily when I told him Woodwardinvented the whole thing, that dumbass fell for it hook, line, and sinker,” said the retired Marine Corps general, explaining how easily he convinced Trumpthat the Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative journalist was lying by just saying “fake news” a couple times and assuring the president that he was an incredible leader. “I thought I might run into some trouble because this is the same excuse I used in April when NBC quoted me calling him an idiot, but nope, he lapped it all up again no problem. I guess I forgot for a second what a drooling, slack-jawed moron the president is. Honestly, even if I had owned up to it, old shit-for-brains probably would have forgotten what I said 15 minutes later.” Kelly added that now that this controversy had been laid to rest, he could focus on steadfastly serving the unconscionable dumbfuck for the remainder of his term."
1146,"WASHINGTON—Fearing for his safety after an incident with Fred Guttenberg the previous day, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was reportedly packing a gun at his Senate hearing Wednesday in case the father ofaParkland shooting victim tried to shake his hand again. “If that son-of-a-bitch comes up and threatens to greet me one more time, he’s got another thing coming,” said a jumpy Kavanaugh, who concealed a semi-automatic pistol in his belt to protect himself against the gun control activist as he appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, reaching toward the firearm several times believing he saw Guttenberg approaching to introduce himself out of the corner of his vision. “I’m not going to sit here unable to defend myself against people trying to meet me—I know my Second Amendment rights. This ismyconfirmation hearing, and if that bastard comes at me again, I’m going to blow off his damn hand.” At press time, a frightened Kavanaugh had grabbed his gun to stand his ground against a threatening black man and shot Senator Cory Booker."
1147,"WASHINGTON—Offering an overview of Americans’ opinions of the commander in chief’s job performance, a new poll released Friday indicated that President Trump’s disapproval rating had reached an all-time none of this matters. The report, released by who really cares which of the utterly useless polling firms and corroborated by several leading increasingly feckless news organizations, confirmed that well over half of those surveyed for really no goddamn reason. In addition, the poll found strong support for who gives a shit, it’s just a bunch of fucking numbers. Sources explained that the change in the polls was in response to something the president did or said that is similar to things he has done or said for years, and that the disapproval rating would change on a whim soon just like it does with every president because those surveyed will have gotten mad about something else or forgotten about it or are just unable to contextualize current events within any sort of historical or societal framework, so simply gathering and staring at a bunch of different statistics doesn’t mean jack shit. At press time, a new poll had found that President Trump’s disapproval rating was now at, Jesus Christ, a sizable portion of the country supports and has always supported an openly white supremacist president and the party he leads, and a bunch of goddamn numerical ratings aren’t going to do a fucking thing to change that."
1148,"JACKSONVILLE, FL—Facing backlash for warning voters not to “monkey this up” and vote for his black political opponent, Andrew Gillum, Republican gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis held a press conference Thursday to clarify that his comments were intended as a subtle enough dog whistle to racists that he could escape blame. “Many of my critics on the left fail to understand that my words were simply meant to fly under the radar and reach an intended audience without repercussions,” said DeSantis, lamenting that his code words caused a media firestorm when his only objective was to target a specific bigoted group that agreed with the message. “This whole media outcry is, frankly, overblown. People are acting like I threw out an actual racial slur when what I actually said was a harmless piece of rhetoric that’s been used to dehumanize black people for centuries. If anything, folks should be upset that ‘monkey this up’ isn’t a real idiom.” DeSantis concluded his press conference by issuing an apology to “Mayor Gillum and his family” followed by a sly wink."
1149,"WASHINGTON—Declaring the rapid decrease in the population of several endangered species “problematic,” Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke called for new legislation Thursday designed to slow the destruction of the nation’s wildlife so that he might relish every last minute of its extinction. “We need to preserve these magnificent animals so that I can watch them suffer one by one,” said Zinke, adding that the more species were preserved, the more opportunities he would have to look on as they starved, choked on garbage, or became caught in bear traps. “Animals, plants, and insects are currently dying out at the rate of 200 per day, and it’s just not humanly possible to savor the death throes of the last of something’s kind if they’re all happening at once. We need to pump the brakes and make an effort to preserve, oh, let’s say, the last thousand Hawaiian harbor seals so that someday my grandchildren can experience the wonder of watching as the life drains from their adorable little eyes.” Zinke concluded by introducing a fundraising measure designed to draw out the suffering of the nation’s most iconic endangered bird by selling T-shirts and bumper stickers emblazoned with the legend “SAVE THE CALIFORNIA CONDOR FOR LAST.”"
1150,"WASHINGTON—Following the release of official reports that attributed 2,975 deaths to the 2017 storm instead of the previous estimate of 64, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he was revoking a significant amount of funding devoted to Puerto Rico after learning that Hurricane Maria had way fewer survivors. “The new data shows that there are substantially less people than we thought who are still alive, which means they don’t need as much money to help each of them recover,” said Trump, adding that he was slashing the $18.5 billion earmarked for the island’s recovery by the Department of Housing and Urban Development by at least $12 billion to $15 billion since “now they don’t need as much food and houses and stuff.” “We want to help the people of Puerto Rico recover from this massive, massive storm, but it’s too late to help people recover if they’re already dead. And, look, I’m not saying the people of Puerto Rico were lying to get more money, but it’s pretty suspicious that they waited until now to tell us how many more people died. At least finding out about the hurricane death toll now means a lot of American money will be saved.” Trump added that the people of Puerto Rico should be pleased about the reduced recovery funding, since there would be less U.S. money wasted there the next time a massive hurricane hits."
1151,"WASHINGTON—Saying the website has mounted a direct assault on free speech, Republicans in Congress told reporters Tuesday they were outraged by reports claiming the pornographic video site RedTube has censored conservative voices on its platform. “Sadly, RedTube displays a consistent left-leaning bias, whether through its temporary ban of outspoken Republican porn star Cindy Lixxx’s popular ‘Spread Bald Eagle’ channel or its hiding of search results for phrases such as ‘Stars and Stripes double penetration,’” said Rep. Steve King (R-IA), who echoed dozens of GOP lawmakers as he argued that such actions not only suppress important voices, but also discriminate against conservative viewers who simply want to see bondage scenes of right-wing cam girls blindfolded and bound with the American flag. “RedTube operates a widely used public forum for the exchange of hardcore materials, and it should not be allowed to determine whether Americans are permitted to watch rock-hard Republicans cuming on the tits of fiscally conservative adult film stars. Otherwise, before you know it, the only pornographic videos online will be liberal bukkake or—I shudder to even say it—socialist gang bangs.” In response, a RedTube spokesperson cited the company’s history of providing a neutral platform and pointed to its long-running offerings favored by establishment Republicans, including the premium pornography channel, “Bush.”"
1152,"HOUSTON—With scenes in which the two little girls can be seen pleading with outstretched arms, a new Ted Cruz campaign ad released Tuesday features the incumbent U.S. senator’s children begging for challenger Beto O’Rourke to be their new dad. “Mr. O’Rourke, could you be our new daddy—please, please, please, with a cherry on top?” Cruz’s 10-year-old daughter Caroline said in the 30-second spot, promising that she and her sister will get straight As and be on their best behavior if the current U.S. representative from El Paso would take over all fathering duties immediately and let them come live with his family. “You’d be a nice, normal daddy, not weird and creepy like the one we have now. We could even introduce you to our friends without being embarrassed. We love you, Beto!” The campaign advertisement concludes with a tearful Heidi Cruz begging on bended knee for O’Rourke to be her new husband."
1153,"WASHINGTON—Controversy surrounding whether the commander in chief was properly honoring recently deceased Senator John McCain increased Tuesday after reports indicated that the White House flag was now being moved up or down on its staff minute to minute to indicate President Donald Trump’s current mood. “It’s no secret that the president and the late senator had a contentious relationship, and President Trump wants the flag’s position to be perfectly calibrated to his current sentiments about Mr. McCain so the nation knows exactly how he feels,” said White House deputy chief of staff of operations Daniel Walsh as facilities employees raced to raise the flag precisely 26 inches above half-staff to reflect a surge of anger Trump had just experienced toward McCain receiving so much public adulation. “Obviously, we lowered the flag to half-staff on Monday after the president plunged into an extended bad mood due to the backlash over raising it to full staff on Sunday, but then we had to lower the flag another fifth of the way down the flagpole early this morning when Mr. Trump woke up and felt even worse about it. Then, at 9:41 a.m., we had to raise it 59 percent up the staff because Mr. Trump was feeling somewhat contrite about not honoring Mr. McCain, but not as bad as before, only to raise it to 86 percent of the way up at 9:49 a.m. because the president decided he didn’t care that much about the senator anymore. For the last couple hours, we’ve been raising and lowering the flag from anywhere to just one quarter of the way up the flagpole to 96 percent of the way up, depending on how mad, sad, guilty, jealous, apologetic, fearful, or annoyed Mr. Trump is feeling about the senator at any given moment. We also had to rush to take it down entirely from 10:47-10:54 a.m. when Mr. Trump just got bored of the whole thing. We’ve definitely been scrambling—wait, I’m just receiving word now that we’ve got to lower it another 2.6 inches because the president is excited about pissing off liberals but he’s also sleepy and hungry.” Walsh added that although it was tiring for his staff to keep raising and lowering the flag, they would keep doing it, because the position of the White House flag is of the absolute utmost national importance."
1154,"WASHINGTON—In a timely tribute to a woman they are calling a fearless American hero, the White House released a statement Monday recognizing and honoring the woman who called then-presidential candidate Barack Obama an Arab during a town hall event in 2008. “It is with great reverence that we celebrate the courage, life, and work of the woman who told John McCain at a 2008 campaign rally that she couldn’t trust Barack Obama because he was an Arab,” the statement read in part. “Despite the fact that it would have been far easier for her to hold her tongue and remain silent, she bravely stood up for her country and called Obama out for being a foreigner, and in doing so, she truly earned the title of ‘maverick.’ A ruthless defender of patriotism who refused to cower during her shining moment on the national stage, she courageously focused national attention on Obama’s Muslim pedigree. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you for your service, ma’am.” The statement concluded by saying that her brave and inspiring comments would live on in this country for generations to come."
1155,"WASHINGTON—In the wake of federal charges brought against the California lawmaker for multiple egregious campaign finance violations, GOP leadership released a statement Friday calling for Congressman Duncan Hunter’s resignation following the revelation that he is, in fact, poor. “Congressman Hunter’s actions simply do not line up with the Republican party’s core principles with regards to the possession of personal wealth. The simple fact that the representative does not have enough money to pay for third or even second homes, private schooling for his children, or basic cosmetic health care, constitutes a betrayal of everything the party stands for,” the statement read in part. “This gross lack of personal finances does not represent the Grand Old Party writ large. That Duncan Hunter held actual middle-class status for years, instead of merely pretending to share middle-class values, is absolutely reprehensible behavior unbefitting a Republican congressman.” Beltway insiders expect Hunter to resign his office and relinquish his House seat to an astoundingly wealthy party member as soon as possible."
1156,"WASHINGTON—Recoiling in horror at the spectacular power of their newly birthed creation, members of the GOP reportedly gasped Thursday as a red-eyed, shadow special counsel smashed out of a gestation tank, with the dark Robert Mueller sputtering, “I will exonerate Trump.” “My God, what have we done?” said California representative Devin Nunes as the merciless identical counterpart to the special counsel, who was created from DNA covertly harvested from Robert Mueller in order to halt the former FBI director’s progress on the Russia probe, exploded from the straps binding him in the incubation chamber, sloughed off the birthing gel, lurched forward, snapped Rand Paul’s neck, and quickly put on the Kentucky senator’s suit. “Look upon him—why, he is both man and beast. The world shall never be the same thanks to this abomination.” At press time, the shadow counsel jumped out of a nearby window and began heading to the D.C. Appellate Court in order to file a writ to have Paul Manafort’s conviction reversed, citing wrongful admission of evidence."
1157,"WASHINGTON—In the wake of Paul Manafort’s conviction and Michael Cohen’s guilty plea, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT) told reporters Thursday that the mounting allegations against President Trump are not yet serious enough to make the scales fall from the eyes of Republicans and allow them to behold the sheer shrieking madness they have begotten. “Simply put, there is at present insufficient evidence against the Trump administration to justify the tearing of blindfolds from Republican eyes at this point, and therefore, we remain safe from gazing in horror at the maelstrom of sheer insanity that we ourselves have loosed upon the world,” said Hatch, claiming it would be woefully premature for Congress to commit themselves to any course of action in which they might glimpse the unveiled face of the ravening madness vomited into existence by them and them alone. “Perhaps six months from now, as even more damning details of the president’s action are divulged, we can more confidently open our eyes to the corrosive reality we unleashed when we damned ourselves by giving birth to this repellent idiot abomination, suckling it on the putrescence of our own squalid ambition, weaning it with pain and hatred in our foul nest of all-consuming mania to slaver forever in the fetid darkness, untouched by mercy or hope. But until then, the GOP will take the wait-and-see approach.” At press time, Hatch declined to support measures to ensure the preservation of the republic should Congress stare into the abyss of their own blasphemous hypocrisy and, in so doing, be consumed by it."
1158,"WASHINGTON—After learning that their father’s associates Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen were guilty of crimes and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation was continuing to expand, Eric and Donald Trump Jr. were reportedly frantically burning stacks of their printed-out emails Wednesday to eliminate their paper trail. “Okay, Eric, I think we melted down all the stuff we wrote from last year so now Mr. Mueller can’t never find it—time to start wrecking all the emails from this year,” said Trump Jr., who, along with his brother, had stayed up all night printing out every single email ever sent or received by either of the boys and setting the stacks of paper ablaze in a plastic garbage can to eliminate any evidence that could be used against them in an investigation. “We gotta type up copies of our texts so we can print them out and burn those, too—you can’t be too careful with the witch hunt. And once we finish burning all the evidence, we have to take pictures of our faces on Instagram and then print out those, too, and burn them so we can delete our identities. Then we have to leave and never come back, okay? We have to go to one of the small dots on a map where they can’t find us.” At press time, the Trump boys were attempting to erase any trace of their deliberate destruction of evidence by using masking tape to secure rocks to the top of the printer and pushing the device into the depths of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool where it would “never, ever be found.”"
1159,"WASHINGTON—Explaining the position was essentially a minor role, the GOP quickly pointed out Wednesday that Michael Cohen was merely the Republican National Committee’s deputy finance chairman. “Look, at the end of the day, all Michael Cohen did was help oversee the finances for one of the two major American political parties in a leading capacity,” said RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, adding that the president’s lawyer, who was under investigation for $20 million in bank fraud, was only the second most powerful person when it came to determining the nationwide organization’s budget and long-term financial goals. “Seriously, he wasn’t in charge of all of the money; there were at least two or three people above him. People are acting like Cohen was this super important figure, but when you look at it, he just worked in a top position for a political group representing over 60 million Americans.” The GOP was also quick to point out that Paul Manafort, who was found guilty of eight counts of financial crimes, only served as the campaign manager for the current United States president, performing minor tasks such as handpicking Mike Pence as Donald Trump’s running mate."
1160,"WASHINGTON—Admitting that it was probably the worst mistake he has made since starting the investigation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller told reporters Wednesday that he immediately regretted coercing Michael Cohen to flip on the president after having to spend time with him. “At first, I thought that getting Cohen to cooperate would be great for the case, but Jesus, I can’t handle dealing with this fucking idiot,” said a visibly irritated Mueller, explaining that gaining valuable evidence on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election straight from a source deep within Trump’s inner circle just wasn’t worth hearing the “smug, insufferable moron blathering on and on.” “We’re only a quarter of the way through, and this obnoxious dumbass is already on my last nerve. I should have just let him go to trial—this is excruciating.” Mueller later conceded that he was happy that Manafort hadn’t flipped yet because he doesn’t think he could handle “30 seconds in a room with that annoying shithead.”"
1161,"WASHINGTON—In a dazzling display of superior intellect and penetrating insight, ingenious political analyst Mark Morelli pointed out Monday the irony of Melania Trump speaking out against cyberbullying when her husband is U.S. President Donald Trump. “Wow, it is so hypocritical of the first lady to criticize cyberbullying when she’s married to a man who regularly uses social media to harass and torment people,” said Morelli, using his shrewd acumen to alert readers to the complex paradox, which most unthinking plebeians lack the brilliance to discern.“I mean, seriously, right after she spoke, he was tweeting insults about his political opponents. Does she not realize the pot is calling the kettle black?” At press time, the nation was thankful to have someone who was so willing to speak truth to power."
1162,"WASHINGTON—Warning that the group was secretly planning to affect the outcome of the November elections, President Donald Trump accused voters Monday of meddling in the upcoming midterms. “It’s clear that the disgusting and disgraceful voters are going to try to influence the midterms—the voters must be stopped!” said Trump in a series of tweets, asserting that millions of voters were potentially involved in a massive, coordinated effort to handpick election winners. “I’ve been hearing about all these voters who are already plotting to go to their polling place, show their ID, and cast their vote all on the same day, and that’s a big problem. And it’s already happening, folks—just take a look at the primaries. We’ve got voters with ulterior motives online, too, trying to influence people by spreading information about candidates on social media. We absolutely cannot as a society allow voters to meddle in our elections, and if we don’t do something, voters will try to interfere with the 2020 presidential election, too.” At press time, Trump’s advisors were reportedly attempting to calm him down by reminding him that there was virtually no evidence to suggest that American voters were interested in influencing midterm elections."
1163,"WASHINGTON—Tearing up while describing how insufficient government funding often fails to cover the cost of essential materials, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos revealed Monday that she was forced to use her own salary to purchase supplies for her yacht. “People are under the false impression that yachts come fully stocked with all the things you’d need to create a great environment, like caterers and live cellists, but they don’t realize that I often have to pay out of my own pocket, and that gets very pricey,” said DeVos, revealing that under the current Department of Education budget, she was obliged to shell out of thousands of dollars to outfit her yacht with all-new bidets. “It’s really tough, because I just want to make sure that everyone who steps foot onto this vessel has an enriching experience that lasts a lifetime. We’re talking about 30 or more guests at every party—it adds up quickly. Just maintaining the wine cellar accounts for nearly one-third of my salary. It’s no wonder so many yacht owners get burnt out after even a short period of time.” At press time, the GoFundMe account that DeVos set up to raise money to redo her marble countertops had already hit $2.7 million in donations."
1164,"NEW YORK—Admitting that he initially started to panic upon discovering that federal prosecutors were investigating him for charges of bank and tax fraud, Michael Cohen reportedly expressed relief Monday after remembering that it is illegal to charge a lawyer with a crime. “Wow, I was really freaking out there for a second thinking I was definitely going to prison, but then I remembered you have immunity from all criminal charges when you’re a lawyer,” said Cohen, adding that his concern over the mounting evidence that he was involved in multiple crimes while serving as President Trump’s lawyer disappeared after he recalled the part of getting admitted to the bar that makes questioning a lawyer about anything they’ve ever done a Class A felony. “I can’t believe I almost forgot that lawyers are the part of the legal system who talk about the laws when they prosecute and defend people for crimes, not the people who actually have laws applied to them. Lawyers obviously get attorney–legal system privilege. Jeez, though, that was close.” At press time, Cohen was growing even more relaxed after recalling all the lawyers he knows who have committed scores of illegal acts and never received any punishment whatsoever."
1165,"WASHINGTON—Growing increasingly flustered while impotently pounding on the front door and pleading to come inside, President Trump was reportedly locked out of the White House Thursday after accidentally revoking his own security clearance. “C’mon, just open the door, guys! I didn’t mean to strip myself of access to classified information and restricted areas,” said Trump, who was forbidden from entering the premises after unwittingly writing his name on the list of individuals having their clearances revoked, thinking it was where he was supposed to place his signature. “Please, I’m sorry! I really wanna come back inside. It was an honest mistake. Oh, no, it’s starting to rain.” At press time, Trump pressed his face up and tapped on the window of the Oval Office, prompting John Kelly to pull down the blinds."
1166,"WASHINGTON—Denying that any attempt had been made to withhold information relevant to the Supreme Court confirmation process, Senate Republicans promised Wednesday there would be plenty of time to review Brett Kavanaugh’s writings once they had become the law of the land. “We’ll have an opportunity to thoroughly vet Judge Kavanaugh’s beliefs as soon as they are established precedent and a permanent part of our nation’s legal framework,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, explaining there was no need for anyone to read Kavanaugh’s thoughts on the environment or immigration since they would be readily available to the public once he sat on the Supreme Court and began issuing opinions. “The Democrats will have decades to closely analyze Judge Kavanaugh’s views on issues such as labor unions, gerrymandering, and executive power. Why should they read a million documents from his time in the George W. Bush administration when they will be able to find out most of what they need to know just by reading his majority opinion striking downRoe v. Wade?” McConnell added that Democratic criticism of Trump’s nominee represented the “same old obstructionist tactics” that in 2032 the Supreme Court will rule is legally punishable by death."
1167,"WASHINGTON—Insisting that it had to be in the audio recordings made during her time in the administration, Omarosa Manigault-Newman was frantically searching Tuesday through tapes of everyone else in the White House using the N-word for one of President Trump uttering the racial slur. “C’mon, c’mon, I know Trump’s in here somewhere,” said Manigault-Newman as she fast-forwarded through a recording of Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions casually using the racial slur during a conversation in the West Wing. “I’ve got hours of John Kelly dropping N-bombs and a several where Trump is in the room when Bannon yells it, but I haven’t found any of the president yet. One tape seemed promising, but there’s a lot of crosstalk where everybody in the room was saying the N-word over each other, so you can’t make out Trump clearly. Ugh, this is going to take forever.” At press time, Manigault-Newman was forced to keep looking after all that turned up so far were two dozen recordings of Trump saying “wetback” and “dune coon.”"
1168,"WASHINGTON—Q, the pseudonymous individual who for the last several months has released classified information about high-ranking government officials and the deep state, reportedly tendered his resignation from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Tuesday after failing to properly file an expense report. “I want to apologize to the American taxpayers for abusing my power as a public servant in the USDA, as well as everyone depending on me to supply high-level classified information from the Trump administration as the leader of QAnon,” said Ray Benjamin, 59, who stepped down from his post as a commodity grader in the Agricultural Marketing Service division of the USDA after 26 years with the agency and nearly a year posting on 4chan and 8chan as Q. “I deeply regret failing to document my $15.35 meal, as well as several other business expenses, including a reimbursement for parking, but ultimately I must own up to my mistakes. Unfortunately, with my security clearance revoked and my access to top-secret government intelligence cut off, it means that I will no longer be capable of posting updates about The Storm, offering informed predictions of Hillary Clinton’s imminent arrest, or unmasking the establishment liberals involved in a massive international human-trafficking ring. I am profoundly sorry to both the Department of Agriculture and to my QAnon supporters. I let you all down.” Reached for additional comment, Benjamin admitted that he was privately relieved that he was no longer under the obligation to run QAnon and could spend more time relaxing with his wife, gardening, and watching University of Virginia football."
1169,"WASHINGTON—In response to former aide Omarosa Manigault-Newman releasing a conversation between the two of them that he didn’t know was being taped, President Donald Trump reportedly condemned White House staffers’ use of a secret recording studio Monday. “I’m shocked and completely furious that people who I generously gave jobs in my administration would turn around and use a secret recording studio during meetings,” said the president, criticizing staffers who constructed a soundproof live room, vocal isolation booth, and mixing console in the West Wing to record, monitor, and master his statements in high fidelity without his knowledge. “I trusted these people not to sit me down and do a soundcheck, request that I do multiple takes, and play back my statements in the room until everyone agrees we’ve got what we’re looking for. I had no idea Omarosa was making suggestions about my microphone placement in between working with the audio engineer during takes, and, frankly, it’s a disgrace.” At press time, Trump criticized the anonymous leak by someone in his administration of a previously unreleased 13,680-hour recording of his entire presidency on iTunes and Spotify."
1170,"WASHINGTON—Suffering yet another unexpected setback during his ongoing investigation into foreign collusion with the Trump campaign, Special Counsel Robert Mueller scrambled Friday to contain the damage to his documents after spilling an entire Grape Crush Big Gulp all over his Russia evidence. “No, no, no! No! Aw, jeez, this is really bad,” said the panicked FBI investigator, frantically scooping handfuls of partially melted purple ice off of a painstakingly transcribed and annotated Michael Flynn interview back into its original 32-ounce plastic cup with his hands and attempting to blot it dry with an extra copy of the evidence inventory from his raid on Michael Cohen’s office. “Everyone’s going to be so mad at me for having my soda next to so much important stuff. Maybe if I spread it all out and let it dry, no one will notice? Dang it. I can’t believe I did this twice in one week.” At press time, Mueller was attempting to wring the purple moisture from Maria Butina’s signed confidential disclosure statement and wondering if 7-Eleven would give him a new soda for free if he explained what happened."
1171,"WASHINGTON—Feigning polite interest throughout the 90-minute meeting, Pentagon officials from all five branches of the armed forces listened in silence Thursday as Mike Pence presented his detailed plans for a state-of-the-art angel-guided weapons system. “Though we are grateful for the vice president’s interest in national defense, the prospect of using seraphim-targeted bombs and heretic-seeking missiles to protect America from hostile sinners is not feasible, nor indeed useful, at this time,” said Secretary of Defense James Mattis, graciously thanking Pence for his hand-drawn schematics of a proposed Holy Ghost cloaking device that would allow planes to fly undetected above the homes of prostitutes and thieves. “Obviously, we cannot plan our defense against North Korea around the face of God appearing before Kim Jong-un and turning him into a pillar of salt, but it’s not like I can tell the vice president of the United States to stop talking. Luckily, he wound down after explaining how the Gabriel’s Trumpet Alert System worked, which is just as well, because apparently the idea behind it is that we would just all ascend bodily into Heaven, which in many ways contradicts our current strategic goals.” The National Guard, however, may consider Pence’s contingency plans for non-lethal counters to possible civil unrest, saying the idea of a crowd-dispersing holy water cannon is “not completely without merit.”"
1172,"NEW YORK—Saying that the affair was rapidly deteriorating into a boondoggle that should have been resolved months ago, presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani demanded Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller stop wasting taxpayer money, wrap up his investigation immediately, and imprison the president no later than September. “This inquiry into President Trump’s dealings with Russia has clearly run its course, and it’s high time that the FBI cuts to the chase and arrests him for his crimes,” said Giuliani, adding that the special counsel’s investigation into Trump’s business practices was “a step too far” and that Mueller’s team almost certainly had enough information on election interference alone to incarcerate the president before Labor Day. “The American people deserve better than this. If the special counsel were any sort of professional, he would publicly admit what everyone knows—that he has all the evidence he needs to build an airtight case against Trump. Dragging this out is a disgrace, a mockery of our legal system. Look, we’re just asking for Mueller to convict the president by the midterms, or the White House will ask Congress to dissolve his team and put Trump in prison ourselves.” In a clear challenge to Mueller’s authority, Giuliani then reported to Hazelton Federal Penitentiary to serve a three-to-five year service for aiding and abetting treasonous behavior against the United States."
1173,"WASHINGTON—Saying he just wants to fit in with his colleagues, shy Rep. Harold Olsen confided to reporters Wednesday that he often feels left out of all the illegal activities going on in Congress and wishes his fellow lawmakers would include him in their crimes. “I see everyone around me committing these felonies—embezzlement, tax evasion, insider trading—and all I want is to join in and be a part of it,” said the bashful congressman from South Carolina, adding that he knows a lot about racketeering and wire fraud, as well as making false statements to federal investigators, and would thus have a lot to offer. “I saw a group of high-ranking congressmen chatting the other day, and I wanted to ask if I could join their money-laundering scheme, but I lost my nerve. It’s so intimidating to approach these guys because they’ve been committing crimes together for years, even decades. But I know if someone gave me a chance, I could prove I’m every bit as seedy as they are. I’ve been misusing public funds on my own for so long—imagine how much we could steal if we worked together!” Olsen added that maybe he could impress his colleagues by inviting them out on the boat he bought with campaign contributions."
1174,"WASHINGTON—Muttering that he needed something more potent to get him flying again, Stephen Miller was desperately searching for his next fix Tuesday after the high of detained children began wearing off. “You get a taste for immigrant children suffering and then you’re always chasing the dragon—now I need at least half a dozen articles about kids being abused by their captors just to get to normal,” said the president’s senior advisor, absentmindedly scratching his arm and pacing back and forth as he sought out photos of crying Mexican mothers, lice-covered infants, or anything else that could provide him with a moment of much-needed release. “The hundreds of families still separated kept me going for a while there, and of course those reports of children being forever changed when they reconnected with their parents were some really good shit. But it’s just not enough anymore. I’m totally jonesing for something big, like an ICE detention center catching fire and burning everyone alive—something that can really get me off.” At press time, a blissed-out Miller had reportedly worked up a pretty good buzz looking at videos of tortured Libyan refugees who were barred from entering the United States under President Trump’s travel ban."
1175,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Speaking to a packed courtroom during his second day of testimony in the fraud trial for his former boss, Rick Gates fondly recalled Tuesday when Paul Manafort found him as a hapless street urchin and taught him how to pickpocket. “I was just a pauper sleeping on the streets of D.C. when I was approached by a peculiar, top-hatted young man, as dirty a juvenile as you’d ever see, but with all the airs of a gentleman,” Gates told prosecutors, explaining that after swiping a bushel of apples from a nearby street vendor, Manafort had introduced him to a gang of ragamuffins headed by an old, shriveled wretch by the name of Roger Stone. “They taught me their ways, and before long, I was filching right proper. Whenever a rich mark would come along, Manafort would distract him while I snuck up behind him and filched his pocket-book or snuff box. Sure, we had to scamper off any time the coppers turned up, but it sure beat living in the workhouse.” Gates confirmed that his partnership with Manafort would have likely continued indefinitely had they not been caught in an unsuccessful attempt to steal Robert Mueller’s monogrammed handkerchief."
1176,"NORILSK, RUSSIA—Following the president’s disclosure that the purpose of the controversial June 2016 Trump Tower meeting was in fact held to collect opposition research on Hillary Clinton, hundreds of Russian orphans were devastated Monday after realizing that Donald Trump Jr. did not in fact call Russian lobbyists to the headquarters of his father’s business in order to arrange their adoptions. “We truly believed the nice Americans were going to save us from this hopeless life of hardship and toil,” said Evgeny Mikhailov, age 9, tearfully unpacking a small suitcase in his boarding house room in a frigid industrial city at the northernmost edges of Siberia and comforting his six hungry, tired siblings as best he could while they sobbed themselves to sleep. “This was the glimmer of hope we needed after the tractor factory took our Mamka and Papenka, but we learn now that all is a sham. We thought the Americans really cared for us, but they were just trying to cover their deceitful tracks.” The more than 25,000 orphans betrayed by the scandal have gone on record to express their satisfaction at learning how President Putin was at least helping oppose the deceitful Trump by supporting American Democrats."
1177,"WASHINGTON—In a stark reversal of past statements on the Trump Tower meeting, President Trump acknowledged Monday that he believed his eldest son would most likely be fine doing five to 10 years in a federal prison. “Despite reports that I’m concerned about my wonderful son being sent to jail, I actually think there wouldn’t be much harm at all if he was imprisoned for a decade or so,” said the president, directly contradicting previous reports that he had expressed worry to aides about his son facing legal repercussions for meeting with Russian agents by noting that Donald Jr. was a “resilient kid” who could easily weather a stint in a federal penitentiary until 2025. “Look, my son is young, he’s got a good head on his shoulders—I bet he’d do absolutely fantastic behind bars. Frankly, I’ve just got no problem with him getting locked up in a cell until he’s around 50. And, honestly, any news story telling you otherwise is a complete fabrication.” Trump also dismissed claims that he had any qualms about never seeing Jared Kushner again if his senior advisor were to receive a life sentence for treason."
1178,"WASHINGTON—In a statement intended to send a strong message to the White House press secretary in response to her controversial and adversarial remarks regarding the media, press corps reporters united Friday to warn Sarah Huckabee Sanders that her veiled accusations and outright untruths were doing deep, untold harm to America and the results were selling like fucking hotcakes. “Secretary Sanders, the pattern of distrust you and the president have established towards the constitutionally protected practice of the First Amendment is eroding Americans’ faith in their nation’s most fundamental institutions, and we’ll be goddamned if people aren’t eating it right the hell up,” said NBC’s Kasie Hunt, who cautioned Sanders that she was in danger of going down in history as the press secretary who spread discord among the American people, threatened the free press, and waged war on freedom of in speech in general, all of which have grown readership like nobody’s business. “Each day that you stand behind the podium and call the press the enemy of the American people is another day you corrode the fundamental trust at the heart of democracy’s basic social contract, and also another deadline where we can just record what you say verbatim, print it, and beat our circulation goals by 35 percent.” Immediately following her statement, Hunt was drowned out by other members of the White House press corps fighting to thank Sanders for keeping their respective publications in the black."
1179,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—In an effort to showcase the former Trump campaign manager’s most positive attributes, Angolan war criminal Abilio Macanga was called to act as a character witness Friday in the Paul Manafort fraud trial. “Paul is a savvy businessman, an upstanding member of his community, and, above all else, one of my closest friends,” said Macanga, a warlord personally responsible for the brutal slaughter of thousands of innocent women and children during the Angolan Civil War. “When I was down on my luck during a particularly difficult diamond smuggling operation, Paul stood by me. And when I was almost assassinated in a coup by my own soldiers, Paul lent me the money to pay the mercenary I used to hunt down and murder the families of those who betrayed me. I wouldn’t be where I am today if it weren’t for that defendant right there, Paul Manafort.” At press time, Manafort’s defense called up their next witness, a trembling former intern who insisted his boss was a great guy who never once threatened to break his fucking legs so bad he’d be walking sideways the rest of his life."
1180,"WASHINGTON––While being briefed on the inhumane, unsanitary, often abusive conditions in facilities housing more than 700 immigrant children who have been separated from their families for months on end, White House advisor and first daughter Ivanka Trump was distraught to learn Thursday that none of the detainees from ages 1 to 12 had even the most basic access to sewing machines. “When I think of those poor kids, caged so far from the factories where they belong, it just breaks my heart,” said Trump, as her chin quivered at the mere thought of the hundreds of young children who had been stripped of their right to make designer bags, shoes, and clothing. “These poor little children have the ideal hand and finger size to make small, precise stitches in profitable designer clothing, and any decent sweatshop should be able to find more than enough room for them. It’s deeply upsetting to picture them just waiting on a cold, empty concrete floor without a single purse or jacket to sew. That any child, regardless of national origin, should be treated like this is an unthinkable waste, and I intend to personally see that these children are reunited with their sewing machines immediately.” Ms. Trump later announced the establishment of the Ivanka Trump Collection Foundation, which will donate thousands of dollars’ worth of garment-making equipment to ICE facilities."
1181,"WASHINGTON—Standing firm in his commitment to one of the nation’s guiding principles, Attorney General Jeff Sessions went on record Wednesday vowing to protect the deeply held religious bigotry of all Americans. “Dating back to colonial times, America has been a place where individuals are free to live in accordance with their own personal prejudices, and I’m dedicated to ensuring our people retain the right to discriminate against others based upon their religion,” said Sessions, condemning what he described as secular trends within society that threaten the freedom to treat people as second-class citizens if they adhere to a different faith or no faith at all. “I was raised in a devoutly intolerant household, so I understand the importance of being allowed to hate in whatever way one sees fit. To me, that’s what being an American is all about.” In his closing remarks, Sessions warned that surrendering the right to discriminate according to religion could be the start of a slippery slope that ends with Americans losing their sacred right to discriminate according to gender, sexual orientation, or even race."
1182,"WASHINGTON—Citing the potential dangers of continued White House attacks on media outlets,New York Timespublisher A.G. Sulzberger revealed Sunday that he asked President Trump to decrease his anti-media rhetoric during their July 20 meeting, excepting those made against “those fuckers atThe Washington Post.” “We urged him to back off of reporters and editors who are performing not just their jobs for their respective news organizations, but a valuable public service, and as members of a free press in a free country, should not have to feel their lives are at risk. I also entreated him to to join us in uniting against those WaPo shitasses,” said Sulzberger, emphasizing thatWashington Postjournalists should not be exempt from being mercilessly ridiculed by Trump and anyone who consumes media. “Using the term ‘fake news’ is harmful for all non-Washington Poststaffers involved and creates an unsafe adversarial atmosphere that should be reserved for enemies of our country, such as, say, allWashington Poststaffers. If this borderline slander continues, it could conceivably lead to violence against respected and skilled journalists who work for credible media organizations, which of course excludes thePost. I think we left that meeting with a real understanding that Trump should tone it down a bit, and redirect his vitriol where it belongs, toward thoseWashington Postdumbfucks.” At press time, Sulzberger believed Trump had listened to his arguments after learning thatThe Washington Postwould be banned from all White House press briefings."
1183,"WASHINGTON—Saying the reports were a ludicrous attempt by the mainstream media to discredit him, President Donald Trump vehemently denied Monday the existence of 2016 Russia meeting commemorative merchandise available at the Trump Tower gift shop. “There is absolutely no evidence to suggest that exquisite, handcrafted Trump–Russia meeting decorative plates are on sale for just $39.99 per plate or $199.99 for the entire six-plate set,” said the president, noting that if such collectibles did exist, they would no doubt feature the portraits and signatures of those who attended the meeting as well as a bonus silver souvenir spoon hand-stamped with the date “6/9/16” at no extra charge. “Despite what CNN might tell you, there is no proof that special-edition T-shirts featuring my son Donald Jr. making a handshake deal with Russian nationals to provide our campaign with dirt on Hillary Clinton are going fast and won’t be on the racks for long. Furthermore, we cannot corroborate that a 2016 Russia Meeting stein handsomely emblazoned with the word ‘COLLUSION’ would make the perfect gift for birthdays, anniversaries, or graduations.” At press time, Trump denied that the low-low prices on the commemorative merchandise would be affected by recent tariffs on Chinese goods."
1184,"WASHINGTON—In response to resurfacing allegations that cast doubt on his brother’s version of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting, Eric Trump aimed a laser pointer at Donald Jr. Friday while rapidly flicking a light switch up and down in order to erase all his memories of the incident. “Come on, Don, keep your eyes super wide open so the memory ray can work,” said the 34-year-old, shining a Trump Organization-branded laser pointer into Donald Jr.’s eyes while repeatedly shouting “You don’t remember the bad stuff! You don’t remember the bad stuff!” “It might hurt for a little bit while the memories are going away, but don’t move or it could give you total amnesia. Here, drink this, too. It’s a forgetfulness potion I made out of all the pills in Dad’s medicine cabinet. He takes ’em all the time and he never remembers nothing.” At press time, a frustrated Eric lost patience and instead opted to use a hammer to smash the memories out of Donald Jr.’s brain."
1185,"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the United States Deputy Attorney General had failed to uphold his oath of office, 11 Congressional conservatives reportedly introduced a resolution Thursday to impale Rod Rosenstein. “Mr. Rosenstein’s tenure has been marked by rampant partisanship, leaving us with no choice but to move forward with articles of impalement,” said Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, telling reporters that, if approved, the motion would require Rosenstein to immediately have his body driven through by a 20-foot pike on the steps of the Capitol Building as a warning to all who would defy the president. “Time and again, Mr. Rosenstein has crossed the line in his investigation into Russian meddling, and we intend to make a statement against these outrages by lancing him from anus to mouth, leaving him alive to scream in agony as he slowly exsanguinates.”At press time, the resolution had stalled after House Republicans were unable to reach a consensus about whether Rosenstein’s eyes should be immediately gouged out or remain in place to be eaten by crows."
1186,"WASHINGTON—Even as they united behind journalist Kaitlan Collins after the Trump administration barred her from attending a press conference with the president, the White House press corps reportedly admitted Thursday that they wished their show of solidarity over a banned reporter could be for a better news organization than CNN. “Obviously, we’ll stand behind any news outlet that has its access suspended, but did it really have to be CNN?” said NBC News chief White House correspondent Hallie Jackson, echoing the sentiments of her colleagues who begrudgingly agreed that any move to infringe upon one reporter’s journalistic freedoms, even if it was someone from CNN, was an assault on the entire free press. “Although we’d much rather stand up for someone from, say, theNew York Times, or C-SPAN, or, Christ, evenThe Hill, it’s important to inform the White House that blocking any news organization from a press event will not be tolerated. Journalists are here to ask tough questions and keep the public informed, and even if they represent a network that never does those things, a ban like this sets a grave precedent. Solidarity with—ugh—CNN.” At press time, CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny issued a statement thanking the press corps for coming together to support holding the powerful accountable and also for whatever it is that CNN does."
1187,"WASHINGTON—Expressing relief that the leaked recording of his meeting with lawyer Michael Cohen revealed more than merely his practice of paying hush money to his mistresses, President Donald Trump told the reporters Thursday that he felt “vindicated” by the captured conversation, during which he clearly and unequivocally demonstrated his yearning for reconciliation between the races, called for an earnest and compassionate ongoing dialogue among those of different faiths, and unequivocally condemned the rampant gender inequality at all levels of American society. “Sure, it might look like I’m only concerned with silencing a Playmate in exchange for a large sum of money, but that’s only because the crooked media edited out my call for Americans of all colors, creeds, and convictions to finally come together as one people and embrace the differences that are ultimately our chief source of strength, instead of using them to sow further discord,” said the 45th president of the United States, citing a section at the recording’s 12-minute mark where he was heard challenging his “brothers and sisters in democracy” to work together and uplift traditionally marginalized groups. “This is far from the first time my words have been taken out of context. Yet this incident only serves to strengthen my resolve. My message was clear then, and it’s clear today: We cannot move forward as a nation unless and until we atone for generations of systemic oppression by committing all our resources to opposing that oppression in all its forms, because the only true measure of a society is in its treatment of its most vulnerable members.” At press time, a Pew Research Center poll showed Trump’s approval rating plummeting to 1 percent among Republicans."
1188,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the release of the secretly recorded conversation between Donald Trump and Michael Cohen could not have come at a better time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders stated Wednesday that playing the tape backward reveals a hidden message exonerating Trump from any misconduct. “I can confirm that if you play these recordings backward and at half speed, you can clearly hear the voice of Barack Obama saying, ‘We should frame Donald Trump so people think it was him, not me, who had all those extramarital affairs,’ and then Cohen saying, ‘You’re my best client, Barack,’” said the White House press secretary, adding that if you turn the treble all the way up and listen closely around the tape’s six-minute mark, you can make out former Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz instructing staffers to steal hacked email servers. “President Trump is actually quite grateful for the release of this tape, as it provides conclusive proof that investigations into his financial transactions and personal life are merely witch hunts meant to distract Americans from the real issues. Try it at home and hear the truth for yourself.” Huckabee Sanders went on to add that, later in the tape, one hears the voices of both Bill and Hillary Clinton confessing to the murder of Vince Foster."
1189,"NEW YORK—Saying the leaked audio of Donald Trump approving a payment to ensure the silence of a formerPlayboymodel had “barely scratched the surface,” embattled attorney Michael Cohen promised Wednesday that even more damaging recordings were widely available to the public already. “You may think this is bad—the president agreeing to reimburse the $150,000 paid out to a woman he allegedly had a yearlong affair with—but trust me, there is alotmore where that came from, and it’s been airing nonstop on every major news network for three years now,” said Cohen, who later teased some of the thousands of potentially compromising statements that are readily accessible on the president’s personal Twitter account and have been since 2009. “What came out yesterday is just the tip of the iceberg. There’s actually a taped conversation with Lester Holt in which Trump openly admits to obstructing justice, and many, many other tapes in which he offers effusive praise for murderous dictators like Kim Jong-un and Rodrigo Duterte.” At press time, sources confirmed Cohen had taken to social media to alert Americans to the October 2016 release of a recording containing an extremely damning conversation where Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women while speaking with formerAccess Hollywoodcorrespondent Billy Bush."
1190,"WASHINGTON—Taking a moment from his now-mundane life to address any lingering uncertainty about the outcome of the highly publicized legal ordeal, a confused Robert Mueller was forced to remind the nation Monday that the Russia Investigation wrapped up months ago. “Wait, doesn’t anyone remember? We arrested a bunch of people and shut down the whole thing. Where were you guys?” said the baffled special counsel, carefully recounting the FBI’s painstaking interrogation and evidence-collection processes, which culminated in a series of trials that had been televised and broadcast across every major television network. “Seriously, I was on TV every day for, like, six months straight. We got nine people arrested on counts of high treason and uncovered a 30-person ring of Russian dark-web cybercriminals. Remember? Is this seriously not ringing any bells?” At press time, Mueller bashfully acknowledged that most of the suspects were eventually released on legal technicalities."
1191,"ARLINGTON, VA—Quietly climbing out from under the sheets and sliding on a trench coat, accused Russian agent Maria Butina slipped away Friday after binding the wrists of a half-naked, blindfolded Robert Mueller to a bed frame with silk scarves. “I’m sorry to duck out like this, but I’m running late for an important date in Moscow. Ciao, Robert,” said Butina, who tossed a French tickler on the special counsel’s bare chest before emptying his wallet, grabbing his gun and FBI identification, and pocketing a small flash drive. “Don’t take this too personally, Robert, I’ve had a lot of fun, but I just don’t think we have much of a future together. You can always drop me a line next time you’re in Russia.” At press time, Butina was in the back of a limousine, wiping away a tear while gazing at the necklace Mueller had gifted her earlier that day."
1192,"WASHINGTON—Revealing that the physical world could no longer bear the weight of numerous contradictory realities, sources confirmed Friday that dozens of Whites Houses have begun to leak from a temporal vortex as President Trump’s rapidly changing story of meeting Putin tears apart space-time. “A White House is blinking in and out of reality atop the Washington Monument, and another has materialized inside the wall of a Georgetown apartment building—it appears the fourth dimensional plane is collapsing in on itself as Trump’s untenable, competing statements rupture the very foundation of time and relativity,” said astrophysicist Maria Steagall, who confirmed an entire unit of the Army National Guard was instantly vaporized attempting to enter the vortex, and several members of the White House press corps were reportedly stretched out for the entire length of the Milky Way Galaxy and then collapsed to the size of a single atom after simply trying to make sense of the president’s conflicting remarks. “One witness reported seeing 6,000 Mike Pences pouring out of a small wormhole in the Cabinet room before suddenly vanishing. Countless universes are colliding and folding over each other every time Trump disputes his earlier statements; this is one of the greatest traumas the fabric of the universe has suffered since the Big Bang. In fact, the sheer heat being created by all these Putin stories battling each other to stabilize space-time may cause a black hole to form at the Earth’s core, causing the planet to implode.” At press time, scientists studying the vortex had confirmed that Trump was President in every single Earth reality and would be forever."
1193,"WASHINGTON—In a sharp rebuke of the President’s failure to denounce Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, the Senate passed a bipartisan resolution Friday preventing themselves from stopping Trump. “Today, in service to the American people, we set aside our differences and reached across the aisle to send President Trump an important message; we will not be the ones to keep him in check,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, detailing the Congressional Paralyzation Act, which passed in a 98-0 floor vote and decreed that no member of congress shall attempt to impede the President’s actions, regardless of how illegal or immoral. “Finally, after months of infighting and delay, our hands are officially tied when it comes to Donald Trump. The president must understand that we will not, and as of today cannot, do anything to stop him. With the support of our colleagues in the House, we remain steadfast in doing absolutely nothing whatsoever to curb his power.” At press time, Senators who had originally rejected the bill, including Jeff Flake and Susan Collins, had taken to social mediato explain why they had ultimately changed their votes to “yes.”"
1194,"WASHINGTON—Saying that their investigation indicated her involvement in election interference went deeper than previously believed, the FBI revealed Thursday that Russian agent Maria Butina traded sex in exchange for all 62,984,828 votes Donald Trump received for president in 2016. “Our inquiry into Ms. Butina recently lead us to documents showing that while acting as a Kremlin asset, she approached every single registered voter in the country and, ultimately, exchanged sexual favors for each of the nearly 63 million votes President Trump received,” said FBI spokesperson Fred Rawlings, adding that the investigation had also concluded that every single dollar Trump received from donors such as Robert Mercer, Sheldon Adelson, and Linda McMahon was given as compensation for sex with Butina. “Beginning in at least 2011, Ms. Butina successfully established back channels with a significant portion of the nation’s 235 million citizens of voting age, ultimately trading enough sex to win Mr. Trump the election. It was clearly a fairly sophisticated operation, as Ms. Butina used intelligence gathered aboutAmerican voters to target people willing to exchange their vote for sex in specific, crucial swing areas such as the upper Midwest, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina as Election Day approached. Our conclusions are clear: Without Ms. Butina’s sexual favors, Mr. Trump doesn’t win the election.” FBI officials added that the investigation into Butina’s involvement concurred with the intelligence community’s earlier findings that Hillary Clinton’s campaign likely lost the 2016 election because it did not offer enough sex to voters."
1195,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concern that he had not done enough to stop the oppressive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Wednesday that he was worried history may judge him harshly for his failure to confront the ruthless tyranny of government food stamp abusers. “What will I say when my grandchildren ask, ‘What did Grandpa Paul do to prevent those cruel and remorseless monsters from collecting $125 per month to spend at the supermarket?’” asked Ryan, who hopes he won’t be viewed as a coward by future generations for not speaking out sooner against the powerful children, seniors, and disabled people who comprise the majority of SNAP’s 40 million low-wage recipients. “How can I sleep at night knowing there are still despotic poor families out there buying groceries and other basic necessities totally unimpeded? God, it just kills me.” At press time, a resolute Ryan decided wallowing accomplishes nothing and resolved to focus his remaining time as House Speaker on saving the country from the iron-fisted rule of impoverished Americans."
1196,"WASHINGTON—Lauding President Trump for his invaluable role in the operation, Special Counsel Robert Mueller informed the public Wednesday that his so-called Russia investigation was in fact merely a cover for an elaborate sting to bring down the Clinton family’s child sex-slavery ring. “The Justice Department has finally been able to track down and arrest everyone associated with the Clinton Foundation’s unconscionable crimes, and it’s all thanks to President Trump agreeing to work undercover and play along with our fabricated accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 election,” said Mueller, explaining that after its agent Seth Rich was killed by the Clintons, the department recruited Trump to distract high-ranking Democrats with social media stunts, continuous denials of Russian involvement in U.S. politics, and glowing praise for Vladimir Putin. “Without the president’s help, we never would have been able to keep the guise of the ‘Russia investigation’ going long enough to launch our successful raids of Comet Ping Pong and secret locations in Haiti—efforts that ultimately brought the Clintons’ human-trafficking crimes to light. Thanks to the heroic actions of Donald Trump, we can all sleep a little more soundly tonight, knowing the world’s children are safe.” Mueller went on to thank the numerous media personalities and Republican lawmakers who first pointed out to federal investigators that the real problem lay in Hillary Clinton’s missing emails."
1197,"WASHINGTON—In response to public outcry over his recent controversial press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin, Senate leaders cautioned Tuesday that it was far too early to discuss Trump. “We understand that many Americans may not agree with everything the president says, but these calls for the Senate to start conversing or thinking about Trump are entirely premature,” said Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), echoing sentiments from fellow Democratic leaders and several Republicans that it would be rash and self-defeating to bring up Trump in the Senate without ample reason to do so. “We’re aware that a few members of the House of Representatives have initiated proceedings to raise the idea of Trump, but what activists and left-leaning politicians need to remember is that impulsively throwing around the concept of Trump will likely do much more harm than good. At this point, there’s just no evidence that we should mention the word ‘Trump’ in the Senate at all.” Schumer also warned that historical precedent had revealed there was very little benefit to be gained from discussing a sitting president in an election year."
1198,"EARTH—Assuming the controversial president of the United States must be in possession of potentially damning information concerning his home country in order to keep them so completely under his control, the rest of the world wondered aloud Tuesday about exactly what Trump has on America that compels the nation to keep him in power. “Whoa, he must have some real bad dirt on the U.S. populace for them to just let him get away with so much unconscionable bullshit. You have to wonder what he knows,” said billions of world inhabitants outside of President Trump’s jurisdiction, further speculating that the only possible explanation for the continued deference of American elected officials, American media, and American citizens to an obviously corrupt and incompetent leader would be Trump’s possession of damaging information that could take down the entire country. “There’s no way a truly proud and free nation would put up with this if Trump weren’t blackmailing them with something really, really bad—something so unspeakably heinous that it would destroy their country if anyone found out. Otherwise, why wouldn’t they nail this asshole to a burning outhouse?” At press time, the world was experiencing a sinking feeling that Trump may have compromising information on them as well."
1199,"WASHINGTON—Tossing a lit match on the assemblage of kerosene-doused case files, transcripts, and seized hard drives, Special Counsel Robert Mueller burned every piece of evidence in his investigation into 2016 election interference Tuesday after hearing President Trump’s pointed critique of the U.S. intelligence community. “God, I can’t believe I’ve wasted more than a year of my life working on something the president thinks is foolish, dumb, and—worst of all—a distraction,” said a visibly upset Mueller, shaking his head as he reminded himself to drop all charges against Paul Manafort and anyone who was arrested or pleaded guilty during the investigation before feeding hundreds of pages of warrants, subpoenas, and indictments into the raging flames. “It’s a real shame because I thought I was getting close to something with those Trump Organization wiretaps, but when the president says you’re being reckless, you listen. Frankly, I just hope he takes Putin up on his incredible offer to work with the Kremlin on a more honest investigation.” At press time, Mueller’s actions had been applauded by the heads of the FBI, CIA, and NSA, who also announced plans to immediately suspend their operations pending review by the White House."
1200,"WASHINGTON—In the aftermath of the president’s controversial meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin in Finland, supporters reportedly praised Donald Trump Tuesday for upholding the traditional American value of supporting murderous dictators for political gain. “It is a proud moment in American history to witness President Trump embracing one of our most cherished principles by ingratiating himself with a foreign tyrant in the service of advancing his political goals,” said Layton, UT resident Carl Fredericks, echoing thunderous approval from dozens of the president’s allies in Congress and the media, as well as millions of voters around the country, for using a meeting with the leader of a repressive regime as an opportunity to get on his good side. “What we saw from President Trump at the summit was an outstanding commitment to maintaining our proud national tradition of cozying up to brutal dictators and sweeping their crimes against humanity under the rug if it’s politically expedient to do so. When Trump chose to side with a murderous despot who has violently eliminated his enemies, cracked down on civil liberties, and caused widespread suffering among his people, he showed beyond a shadow of a doubt that he’s an American president in the mold of his predecessors. He’s a true patriot.” In addition, Trump’s supporters praised him for his continued efforts to uphold the longstanding presidential tradition of getting America involved in foreign conflicts they were in no way prepared for out of sheer arrogance and hubris."
1201,"WASHINGTON—Promising citizens that they would finally take action if the President crossed this new red line, GOP leaders announced Monday that they were moving their goalposts for opposing Trump to him being filmed masturbating on an American flag in Arlington National Cemetery. “After today’s attack on U.S. intelligence agencies, we have officially moved our line in the sand to President Trump being caught on video, vigorously pleasuring himself to completion amid the graves of fallen U.S. soldiers,” said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who claimed that in order for Republican officials to begin blocking Trump’s nominations or voting against his policies, the video must be at least a half hour of the president with his pants around his ankles, humming the national anthem, and giving the middle finger to the Tomb Of The Unknown Soldier. “Unless we see clear footage of President Trump looking into the camera, his face twisting in pleasure as he climaxes, we will refrain from taking any concrete measures to reel him in. If Trump is masturbating on a flag anywhere other than Arlington, or if he does not ejaculate directly on Old Glory, we will continue to stand behind him.

1202,"WASHINGTON—With results that were consistent across every demographic group in all 50 states, a poll published Monday by the Pew Research Center revealed that 97 percent of U.S. citizens do not know who Donald Trump is. “When interviewed, the overwhelming majority of Americans did not recognize Donald Trump’s name, did not know he was associated with the federal government, and were unable to state whether he was a living person or a historical figure,” said pollster Jason Costello, adding that an even greater proportion of survey respondents, 99 percent, could not point to the correct picture when presented with photographs of the president and three other people. “Approximately 89 percent of the individuals we questioned merely shrugged or shook their heads upon hearing the words ‘Donald Trump,’ while 7 percent said the name sounded vaguely familiar, but they couldn’t quite place it. Another 2 percent incorrectly identified Trump as the owner of the Dallas Cowboys.” The survey also discovered that an alarming 18 percent of Americans were unable to name current Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue."
1203,"WASHINGTON—In a move that experts believe could upend the confirmation of President Trump’s second Supreme Court justice, the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh had reportedly begun to falter Friday afterThe Washington Postpublished a shocking editorial claiming he neglected to attend his eldest daughter’s piano recital in the fall of 2013. “This is exactly the sort of bombshell that a lot of conservative analysts have been worried about,” said NPR political reporter Asma Khalid, noting that several key Republican senators were questioning their endorsement after learning the D.C. Circuit judge had flagrantly decided to work late at the office instead of listening to his then-8-year-old daughter plunk out “The Sleepy Cat” for an audience of students, parents, and faculty. “Susan Collins of Maine, for instance, has already signaled that she has serious doubts about Kavanaugh’s commitment to protecting women’s rights if, as reported, it took him until the following morning to view the iPad footage of his own daughter’s culminating musical performance. Though supporters will claim he put the wrong date in his Google calendar or that he ran into traffic on the way to the school, this black mark on his record has many concerned that Kavanaugh simply does not have the judgment or moral integrity to serve on the nation’s highest court.” Khalid also cautioned that Kavanaugh’s nomination should not be counted out entirely, pointing to a blisteringWall Street Journalopinion piece that failed to derail Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s nomination despite persuasively arguing that she is of Hispanic descent."

There are dozens more messages just like this, calling our distinguished colleague a ‘pointless fuckwad’ and a ‘moronic scumbag’ that I would like submitted for the record.” At press time, Goodlatte had called for Strzok to be held in contempt for refusing to answer questions about how far he believed Gowdy’s head was up his own ass."
1205,"WASHINGTON—Indulging his secret weakness for rule-breaking after months of toeing the unbreakable line of Republican politics as usual, Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan used his monthly cheat day to indulge in one single bipartisan vote. “God, it feels so naughty—it really is naughty—but after weeks of opposing the welfare state on a non-corporate level, I get an incredible rush by voting across the aisle,” said Ryan, noting the “delicious transgressive spice” of joining hands with Democratic members of Congress to fund the Veterans Administration’s efforts to provide mental health counseling for American soldiers who had been wounded in combat. “That was wrong. I know that. But there’s an upside to this—after the thrill of my brief rebellious phase fades, I’ll realize I actually provided help for American citizens, and the anger and regret I feel over that will help keep me on the straight and narrow party line for the rest of the year.” At press time, the House speaker had been sighted on his hands and knees in the street in front of Capitol building, pledging between spasms of dry heaving that he would never let himself slip up like that again."
1206,"BRUSSELS—Suddenly overcome by a swell of emotion while rebuking the other members for their unwillingness to share the burden of mutual security obligations, a tearful President Trump admitted Wednesday to his fellow world leaders that the NATO alliance is the closest thing to friendship he’s ever had. “I’m sorry to get so sentimental, but this is really the first time in my life that I’ve ever even come close to experiencing a real sense of camaraderie with other human beings,” said a sniffling Trump, his voice cracking while noting that he can’t remember a time prior to their yearly summits when he felt like he belonged and could be his true self. “I know that we argue and say some really horrible things to each other sometimes, but this relationship I have with all of you is so special to me. The bond that the 29 of us share is my dearest, most cherished possession, and I will treasure it always.” Trump then asked his allies to forgive his emotional display before reminding them that if they don’t put forward the full 4 percent of their GDP for defense, they can “all fucking forget about receiving any U.S. military support in the future.”"
1207,"BRUSSELS—Blasting member states for failing to contribute their “fair share,” President Trump demanded at a summit meeting Wednesday that NATO allies match the U.S. commitment to making military spending a far greater national priority than healthcare. “In the United States, we’ve gone above and beyond to make sure military expenditures are our number one concern above all else, including access to life-saving medications for sick people, and it’s high time other NATO countries did the same,” said Trump, lambasting German chancellor Angela Merkel and other leaders who he remarked “really ought to be spending maybe even 50 percent of their GDP” on defense instead of endlessly sinking funds into essential medical care for their citizens. “It’s absolutely disgraceful how the United States comes in and picks up the slack for these nations who insist on throwing their money away on the prevention and treatment of deadly diseases. It’s an embarrassment, everyone’s laughing at us, and I’ll tell you what—we aren’t going to put up with it anymore.” Representatives from the 28 other NATO countries later issued statements concurring with Trump’s assessment that the United States has become a laughingstock."

Q: What does President Trump’s executive action do? A: Helps ease the burden of America’s immigrant detention centers by just turning people away at the airport. Q: When did Trump file the original travel ban? A: Shortly after the beginning of his term in 2017, nearly 300 years ago. Q: Who will be exempted from the travel ban? A: Anyone with a valid tourist or terrorist visa. Q: Wait, didn’t Trump say America’s federal courts are weak and unjust? A: Sure, except when they’re strong and fair! Q: Did the current composition of the Supreme Court affect the ruling? A: Yes, experts say the ban was only upheld due to the appointment of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court in 2016 by President Mitch McConnell. Q: How are human rights groups reacting to the Supreme Court’s decision? A: The ACLU has released its 29,745th “history will judge this harshly” statement since Trump took office. Q: What future impact will this ruling have? A: Sets an important precedent for rolling back the Constitution to apply to only the people the original founding fathers intended."
1210,"WASHINGTON—Frustrated by what she called “obvious misconceptions” related to the Trump administration’s detention of thousands of migrant children who have been forcibly separated from their parents, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders reminded journalists Friday that children under the age of 14 are unable to experience pain. “Look, no matter how much phony controversy the Democrats generate, it’s a simple fact that illegal alien criminals this young are still developing the part of the brain that feels pain, goes through emotional trauma, and retains memories,” said Sanders, explaining that while migrant children may appear to be crying, screaming, or begging for their parents, they are merely attempting to mimic actions they have observed in regular humans. “Furthermore, it’s important to keep in mind that we are talking about foreign children—even if they somehow manage to see their families again, environmental factors may prevent them from developing the capacity to even recognize them. I mean, they live in cages, for God’s sake.” Huckabee Sanders further noted that, were the children to actually receive the sort of care and attention necessary to develop minds and bodies capable of experiencing the pain of what they are currently going through, they would only have the child welfare policies of the Obama administration to blame."
1211,"NEW HAVEN, CT—At a loss to explain the mysterious nature of the president’s powers, political scientists were reportedly baffled Wednesday by Donald Trump’s ability to end the practice of separating families who cross the U.S. border seeking asylum mere days after stating that he had no control over it. “Just yesterday, he was explaining that his hands were tied and there was nothing he could do to stop children and infants from being forcibly torn away from their parents and put into cages—but then today, out of nowhere, he suddenly issued an executive order doing just that!” said Bruce Ackerman, a constitutional law professor at Yale University, remarking that this inexplicable development will fundamentally upend how the presidency is understood, because there is no theory in the entire field of political science that explains how it could be possible. “No new amendments to the Constitution have been passed, so the powers vested in the Executive Branch should be the same today as they were yesterday, right? And yet somehow, they have changed! Decades of research will be required before we can even begin to comprehend such a phenomenon. In the meantime, we can only sit back and wonder if there are any other powers the president has yet to discover.” At press time, sources confirmed Ackerman and his colleagues had flipped over an original copy of the Constitution and found a list of previously unknown executive powers that appeared to have been hastily scrawled in with a ballpoint pen.

I’ve listened to this recording dozens and dozens of times in the past day, and it’s just simply nowhere near enough to scratch the itch. Shame on you, ProPublica.” Miller added that the one silver lining was the likelihood that other outlets would soon broadcast hours of comprehensive, high-quality footage of immigrant children being tormented.

1213,"WASHINGTON—In response to criticism of the Justice Department’s “zero tolerance” policy stripping migrant children away from their parents and placing them in detention centers, Attorney General Jeff Sessions argued Monday that family separations are only happening because current law doesn’t allow him to strangle immigrants with his bare hands. “Simply put, I am forced to tear kids away from their parents, because I am legally prohibited from throttling immigrants until their bodies go limp,” said Sessions, asserting that the practice of locking children away in cages and deporting their parents before they can be reunited would be reversed as soon as the law was updated to permit the attorney general to press his thumbs deep into migrants’ windpipes as he watches the life fade from their eyes. “Look, I want to see these poor immigrants dead as much as the next guy, but it’s simply out of my control. I agree that it’s a huge tragedy that I cannot snuff the life out of these migrants together as entire families, but I have a moral duty to follow the law as written.” At press time, Sessions called on Democrats to stop their obstructionist tactics and pass legislation granting him the ability to pin down each individual in the immigrant families and suffocate them one by one.

1214,"WASHINGTON—Standing up to the government agency in a blistering essay published in theWashington Post, former First Lady Laura Bush wrote a courageous op-ed Monday calling for the imprisonment of whoever created ICE. “Separating children from their parents is an unconscionable moral tragedy, and everyone involved should be held accountable, specifically whatever monster is responsible for bringing this criminal agency into existence,” wrote Bush in the op-ed, adding that there was nothing in ICE’s 15-year history to suggest that separating families and imprisoning children in cages was in any way a deviation from the agency’s intended purpose, and any official who says otherwise is either a liar or an idiot. “Whoever is responsible for this atrocity should be tried in the Hague and punished to the fullest extent of international law. Look, ICE was obviously intended to be a punitive, discriminatory organization—it’s under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security, for fuck’s sake. It’s a stain on America’s record. I ask you to join me in calling for whoever established this agency to be thrown into prison to rot. Fuck them.” Bush’s op-ed comes on the heels of fellow former First Lady Michelle Obama’s recent piece in theNew York Timesdemanding full prosecution of whatever morally bankrupt political official permitted ICE to continue growing increasingly unaccountable and sadistic throughout the early 2010s.

1215,"WASHINGTON—Claiming that the administration’s policy was rooted in a clear moral authority, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly defended separating immigrant families Friday by citing his senate confirmation vote. “I would remind anyone concerned about the ethics of removing asylum-seekers from their children that I sailed through my confirmation hearing with a vote of 52-47,” said Sessions, quoting at length from a transcript of his testimony in which his history of racially charged remarks and actions were discussed in detail. “We’re not just talking about immigration hardliners here, either—Dean Heller, John McCain, Susan Collins, and even Joe Manchin all gave me their endorsement. These senators were certainly aware of what actions I was likely to take as Attorney General, so why would they have decided to confirm me if these policies were unjust? The relative smoothness of my hearing proves that we are on the correct and righteous course.” Sessions also cited the continued lack of impeachment proceedings against him as a sound justification for eventually rolling back the rights of legal immigrants who have lived in the country for decades."
1216,"WASHINGTON—Claiming that such an obviously corrupt and dishonest individual could not be trusted to provide accurate testimony, the president’s lawyers reportedly moved to discredit Michael Cohen Thursday by pointing out his long history of committing crimes for Donald Trump. “We’re talking about a man who has threatened and slandered multiple women that Trump slept with, so how are we supposed to believe anything he says?” said attorney Rudy Giuliani, telling reporters that Cohen’s decades-long track record of wire fraud, tax evasion, and brokering shady real estate deals at the behest of the Trump Organization suggested he would likely tell investigators anything they wanted to hear in order to save his skin. “This isn’t just someone who made a few mistakes—whether it was laundering Ukrainian money through Trump properties in the early ’90s or violating campaign finance laws to benefit Trump during the 2016 election, Cohen has proven time and again that he is an inveterate liar and scofflaw. And these are only the crimes we know that he carried out for Trump. In the weeks ahead, we expect many more illegal practices to surface, which will only confirm Michael Cohen’s complete lack of morality.” Giuliani added that Cohen’s felonious conduct was evident from his known association with high-profile criminals including Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, George Papadopoulos, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr."
1217,"WASHINGTON—Saying the decision represented what was best for himself and for the nation, Frank Giaccio, the 11-year-old boy best known for mowing the White House lawn last September, told reporters Wednesday that he has decided to flip on Trump. “After extensive discussion with my legal representatives, I’ve realized that the right move for me is to cooperate with the special counsel and tell them everything I gleaned about the president while mowing the Rose Garden lawn late last year,” said Giaccio, explaining that as he watered a row of tulips close to an open West Wing window, he overheard the commander in chief reveal potentially incriminating information related to his finances, undisclosed interactions with foreign agents, and his intentions while firing former FBI director James Comey. “The stakes surrounding this case are higher than ever, and it’s time for me to cooperate. Despite my choice, I remain steadfast that neither I nor my lawn-mowing company have done anything wrong.” At press time, sources close to the special counsel stressed that Giaccio had no choice but to cooperate after the FBI raided his house and seized his lawnmower and safety goggles."
1218,"AUGUSTA, ME—Advising caution as residents go to the state’s gubernatorial and congressional primaries Tuesday, election experts warned that Maine’s new voting system may lead to a greater risk of citizens getting their finger pinched by a live lobster stuffed into the ballot box. “These rules endanger voters by significantly increasing the likelihood of a claw popping out of the slot and latching onto an unsuspecting Mainer,” said Common Cause spokesperson Regina Watson, adding that the state’s volunteer poll workers had been grossly unprepared for the massive uptick in finger lacerations already occurring under the new procedure. “We have predicted rampant median and ulnar nerve damage across all voting precincts, as well as hundreds, if not thousands, of completely severed fingers. If this system isn’t fixed going forward, there’s a real chance these crustaceans will end up in electronic voting machines, where they can smash through the screens and violently squeeze the appendages of Americans simply trying to exercise their constitutional rights.” At press time, Watson reaffirmed the seriousness of the matter, noting that she once caught a 27-pounder off the coast of Stonington that would “snap your hand clean off.”"
1219,"SINGAPORE—Saying the agreement represents a major high point in American international relations, President Trump concluded his summit with Kim Jong-un Monday by securing a $10 billion trade deal to sell both strategic and tactical nuclear warheads directly to North Korea. “There was some negotiating involved in getting [Jong-un] to buy as many nukes as we wanted to sell, but by cutting the price, we came out with a deal that’s profitable for America and therefore good for the world,” said Trump of the pact, which requires the United States to provide the East Asian authoritarian state with 50 thermonuclear fusion weapons over the next five years. “We’re taking this $10 billion and investing it right back into our economy, our arms industry, and especially our great military, because now more than ever we’re going to need them to help train, supply, and reinforce North Korean troops.” At press time, Trump had threatened to pull out of the deal in a series of invective-laced tweets accusing Kim Jong-un of attempting to acquire $10 billion worth of nuclear weapons."
1220,"PARIS—Waiting in anticipation of the meeting between U.S. president Donald Trump and North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un, dozens of world leaders reportedly expressed hope Monday that the Singapore summit would lead to North Korea becoming a normal impoverished country they don’t have to think about. “I think I speak for all first-world leaders when I state our fervent wish that Kim Jong-un pledges to denuclearize so we don’t have to give a shit about North Korea or its people ever again,” said French president Emmanuel Macron, adding that the leaders looked forward to the day when North Korea would just be some unthreatening, easily ignorable country with lots of suffering on the level of Eritrea, Cambodia, or the Ivory Coast. “For far too long, North Korea has been able to remain in the spotlight among world nations because its nuclear program poses a potential danger, and it is long past time for it to become one of the many also-ran nations with rampant poverty and widespread human rights abuses that we don’t need to mention much, like, say, Laos or Guinea Bissau. If Trump is able to get Kim to agree to denuclearize, it will be a truly monumental step in our efforts to avoid having to ever consider what life is like in poor nations.” Macron added if the Singapore summit failed to advance peace talks with North Korea, they were optimistic that the resulting nuclear war could vastly reduce the number of impoverished countries altogether."

I mean, the look on his face—it was like a guy who just found out he married his second cousin or got 9 percent of the vote in a Republican primary—just a total, irredeemable jackass.” At press time, Giuliani was forced to walk back his comments by Trump’s actual lawyer, Emmet Flood."
1222,"WASHINGTON—Responding to criticism that he has repeatedly spent money intended for agency use on personal items, lavish travel, and other unnecessary expenditures, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt reportedly claimed Wednesday that the funds he has misappropriated would have only been wasted on dumb shit like clean water. “Everyone knows that the EPA would’ve just squandered these funds on stupid-ass stuff like providing potable water to a bunch of fucking kids or whatever if I hadn’t used it first,” said Pruitt, questioning why he should let the EPA fritter away American taxpayers’ hard-earned cash on “useless bullshit” like fuel standards, maintaining air quality, and preventing contamination. “I just don’t understand why people are getting all riled up about me taking personal trips on private jets or trying to get my wife a job at Chick-fil-A—do they seriously want me wasting my time appointing scientists to high-level posts or researching climate change? Ooh, yeah, let’s piss away all our funding trying to uphold dumb crap like physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters, great idea.

People here are really starting to freak out; I saw [CNN reporter] Jim Acosta dash out of the room—it looked like he’d been driven mad. After someone asked about the president’s reaction to the Mueller probe and both of them just pointed to each other and said ‘Do not be tempted by her lies,’ I don’t know what to think.” At press time, the confused White House reporters decided to just print everything said in the room by both Sarah Huckabee Sanderses without clarification or comment."

He just wants to ride to glory. Don’t bother looking for him.

1226,"NEW YORK—Reflecting on his past indiscretions in light of the #MeToo movement, former President Bill Clinton admitted Monday that knowing what he knows now, he would have still preyed on women. “Man, if I had to do it all over again, I’d probably just do the same horrible stuff to all those girls,” said Clinton, adding that deep down, he felt that taking advantage of a 22-year-old intern just seemed like something he would do again if given the chance. “I did the right thing by acting true to my heart, and that’s God’s honest truth. So, no, I don’t regret making so many unwanted romantic advances. In fact, I cherish each and every one of them. What can I say? I truly adore the chase. Bird’s got to fly. Horse’s got to run.

You belong here—stay, and rule as ensorcelling enchantress of the fae-forest entire!” cried the handsome, winged ruler to the quietly weeping first lady as a throng of forest denizens from sobbing wood-nymphs to heartbroken sylphs to the humblest of sorrowful chipmunks tugged on her cloak of starlight and nipped the ankles of her woven-fern slippers in a futile attempt to prevent her leave-taking. “You’ve dwelt among us for two-and-twenty days, Melania—our mossy bourne has become your true home! How could you ever return to the dull world of discord, clamor and cruelty from whence you came? Please abide, we beg of you!” Elven sources reported that Melania spake not a word, but gazed upon each and all of her newfound friends with brimming eyes, pressed a small purple amulet of remembrance into the hand of the King, and disappeared from the hollow into a shimmering purple cloud, violets and asters blooming where her o’er-welling tears kissed the blessed earth."
1228,"WASHINGTON—Speaking to Steve Doocy during an interview withFox & Friends, President Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani laid out the legal framework Monday that would allow him to remain on TV for the next couple years. “The president absolutely has the authority to delay meeting with [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller for several months as I continue to go on talk shows every week defending that decision,” said Giuliani, detailing the procedural steps that would provide a basis for the former New York mayor to appear on a wide swath of current event programs on a variety of networks well into 2020. “This is a complex case, and it could easily take 100-120 more guest bookings before we’ve even scratched the surface of the underlying legal doctrine. Once Mueller finally delivers his findings, it will still take a long time to untangle the relevant federal and state statutes during high-profile conversations with Sean Hannity, Anderson Cooper, and many other prime time hosts, all of which doesn’t even begin to account for the various radio, print, and online interviews that I will be undertaking nonstop during this period.” After facing pushback about his arguments, Giuliani reportedly defended his legal opinion by pointing out that he had specialized in this area for practically his entire career."
1229,"WASHINGTON—In a controversial 7-2 decision that has left civil liberties advocates fuming, the U.S. Supreme Court Monday ruled that gay rights do not extend to dessert. “While homosexuals do have the right to get married, the right to equal treatment does not cover instances of pastry, cake, or candy,” said Senior Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, noting that the law draws a clear line of demarcation between discrimination taking place during a meal’s main course, which is illegal, and bigotry occurring later, over pie or tiramisu, which is protected by the First Amendment rights of the confectioner. “We are choosing to define ‘dessert’ in the broadest possible terms. This means that gay rights will not be applicable in cases of ice cream, sorbet, decorative cookies, or any other post-meal treats, be they sweet or savory. Tiny glasses of port and cheese plates will also fall under the umbrella of ‘dessert’ unless they are consumed before the entrée and defined specifically as ‘apéritifs’ in the appropriate section of the relevant menu.” Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented to the decision, citing irreconcilable time-of-day-related ambiguities in the meal-versus-course classification of the common donut."

President Abe Lincoln adds note at the end of the Emancipation Proclamation clarifying that his freeing the slaves means Republicans can never, ever be accused of being racist. Cartoonist Thomas Nast popularizes the party’s mascot, an elephant that hates poor people. President Benjamin Harrison presides over only four-year stretch in American history where literally nothing happened. Congress votes to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy, and the GOP learns an important lesson about not relying on fear and demagoguery to win elections. Democratic and Republican parties decide to switch platforms out of boredom. Richard Nixon becomes the only Republican president to face consequences for his actions. Party leaders realize they can just say “welfare queens” instead of “lazy minorities.” Republicans sweep midterms on the back of the “Contract With America,” which promises they’ll be beholden to interests of a completely different set of lobbyists than the Democrats.

1232,"WASHINGTON—Eyes widening in terror as she scrolled through the day’s images, chief official White House photographer Shealah Craighead became increasingly disturbed Thursday after discovering a faint, ghostly image of Melania Trump in the background of every photo she had taken. “I swear the State Dining Room was completely empty when I shot these. Oh, my God, there she is again,” said Craighead, visibly shaken by the apparition of the first lady lingering in the back of the Roosevelt Room, her face strangely expressionless, her translucent arms reaching toward the camera. “This is really freaking me out—I haven’t seen her in weeks, let alone photographed her, and yet she’s in every single one of these pictures. I definitely would have noticed if she’d been sobbing in the corner during today’s full cabinet meeting.” Craighead added that after analyzing the photos, she discovered that Mrs. Trump’s shade seemed to assume a more solid form the closer she was to the site of the mysterious sinkhole that recently appeared on the White House’s North Lawn."
1233,"WASHINGTON—Following months of bruising criticism from Democrats and President Trump alike, an inconsolable Jeff Sessions was reportedly trying to commit suicide Thursday by smoking a joint. “I swore I’d never take the coward’s way out, but what choice do I have?” said a teary-eyed Sessions, carefully laying a sealed envelope containing his farewell note on a tool bench in his garage as he raised a lighter to the marijuana cigarette with trembling hands. “This is it. I’ve taken four puffs to make sure there’s no chance of survival. It should only be a matter of minutes now. Oh, what a wretched, ignominious ending. Goodbye, cruel world, I’m sorry I’ve failed you so.” At press time, Sessions reportedly realized he had died after being overcome by a euphoric, floating feeling."
1234,"HAMDEN, CT—Pollsters from the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute reportedly informed former president George H.W. Bush on Wednesday that dying so soon after the passing of his wife, Barbara, would dramatically boost his favorability rating with the American public. “According to our data, perishing on the same night as your beloved would have done wonders for your legacy, but you still have time,” said Douglas Schwartz, director of Quinnipiac University Poll, telling the 41st president that recent reports of his sexual misconduct would soon be forgotten if he were to pass away just over six weeks after the former first lady. “Listen, the longer you wait, the worse it looks. At this point, you’re probably losing half a percentage point per day. Otherwise, you’ll have to live until 100 to see this kind of sweet cultural capital again.” Schwartz added that if the former president didn’t seize the opportunity soon, Bill Clinton, who “appears like he could drop dead any second,” might suddenly kick the bucket and steal his thunder."
1235,"FRESNO, CA—Emphasizing that a clean break was probably best for all parties involved, prominent Republican donor David Heyward announced Tuesday that he contributed $4.5 million to Devin Nunes on the condition that the California representative and House Intelligence Committee chairman retire upon receipt of the funds and never show his face again. “No questions asked, just cash the check and go do something—anything—else,” said Heyward, 57, adding that several of his wealthy, Republican friends were prepared to “sweeten the pot” as soon as they could secure ironclad assurance that Nunes would never again speak on the record or be seen in public. “You’re what, in your 40s now? Great, great—so buy a plane ticket and travel the world for the next couple decades. Play some golf. Take up painting. Buy a boat. Seriously, we don’t really care what you do, but please, for the love of God, do it someplace that is not California’s 22nd congressional district.” Heyward’s offer was made mere weeks after a flood of grassroots donations briefly crashed a GOP fundraising page promising to send Nunes on a lengthy fact-finding mission near Earth’s oceanic pole of inaccessibility."

Just a pandering, feckless asshole with the personality and intelligence of roadkill. Meeting him in person was one of the worst encounters of our lives—he and his whole family can go fuck themselves.” World leaders finished their comments by adding that if there were any justice in the world, Mike Pence would rot away alone in the dank halls of a federal penitentiary."

And tell your pal King Jong-un [sic] not to mess with the trade deal either, or Dad’s gonna be real mad and then nuke all of you with the army. We need 100 more dollars to make the deal work and that’s our final offer. And no trade-backs!

1238,"WASHINGTON—Following a period of uncertainty during a months-long FBI background check, Senior Adviser to the President Jared Kushner told reporters Thursday he’s excited to finally visit the White House after gaining permanent security clearance. “Oh, my God, I can’t believe I’m going to see where the president works,” said an elated Kushner, adding that his mind raced while imagining himself strolling through the halls of the West Wing or standing outside the “real-life, honest-to-goodness Situation Room.” “I can’t wait to check out those big columns out front. I doubt I’ll be allowed in the Oval Office or anything like that, but it’s still going to be so awesome to just walk on the South Lawn. I mean, I’ve obviously seen the place in movies, but I bet it’s way different to be where the magic happens. I might be in the same room as an actual cabinet member! How cool is that?” At press time, the FBI had revoked Kushner’s security clearance after deciding his overzealous behavior posed a high risk."

1240,"WASHINGTON—Challenging American citizens to band together, rise up, and break out of their “mind prisons,” mohawked former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson Thursday warned that U.S. democracy was being threatened by plutocratic fascist pigs fucking over the working man. “These totalitarian autocrats are coming to fuck you, man,” said Tillerson, pausing briefly to strike a match off his teeth, light a hand-rolled cigarette, and mutter that the goddamn fat cats love seeing all us hamsters spin in our little wheels to power their trip. “You all need to stop being fucking sheep and see the world for what it is, man. It’s past fucking time we went out and dragged these corporatist parasites kicking and screaming through the streets—and if anybody disagrees, I’ve got two middle fingers for them right here.” Tillerson responded to a follow-up question concerning his relationship with Donald Trump by saying “here’s how I feel about that piece of shit,” flipping over the lectern, and kicking Breitbart correspondent Charlie Spiering in the crotch."

By all accounts, the man is barely sentient.” The committee went on to confirm that a recent questioning of brother Eric Trump resulted in a surprising amount of information regarding dinosaurs and fire trucks."

As far as we’re concerned, everyone can just have at it.” At press time, reports confirmed the court adjourned for a brief recess during which several of the justices personally tested the waters with necrophilia."
1243,"WASHINGTON—After spending the better part of Monday afternoon watching live television coverage of the demonstrations in the hotly contested Gaza Strip, Donald Trump declared himself “absolutely fascinated” by the Israeli cultural tradition of slaughtering protestors. “It’s very beautiful, such a beautiful custom,” said Trump of the cherished Israeli pastime of mowing down unarmed Palestinians with rifle fire. “They’ve been doing this for years, but this is the first time I got a chance to watch the whole ritual. It’s really something, very powerful. Other countries use just tear gas, but here, they outright murder people for throwing glass bottles. I can really see something like this catching on in the United States.” Trump added he was “particularly moved” by the portion of the festivities that celebrated a 13-year-old Palestinian boy becoming a dead man."
1244,"DALLAS—Acknowledging the company had made a serious error in its efforts to curry favor with the president, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson reportedly admitted Friday that he regretted hiring Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to help its merger with Time Warner go through instead of just dropping a ton of cash off at the Trump International Hotel like everyone else. “On behalf of AT&T, I apologize for our decision to pay Mr. Cohen to influence the president’s agenda and not just drive up to the back door of the Trump hotel in D.C. with a briefcase full of cash,” said Stephenson, adding that the $600,000 the company paid Cohen as a political consultant would have been put to much better use as part of a collection of unmarked bills in a duffel bag handed off to a guy in the hotel lobby. “I regret trying to use Mr. Cohen as a middleman instead of just going directly to the Trump hotel with our bribe and being done with it. Not only did we have to deal with all of Mr. Cohen’s disorganized bullshit, as well as his pretty shocking lack of knowledge on how regulatory reform actually works, but we also were never sure how much of our money was actually being used to influence the administration’s policy-making. I can assure everyone that from now on, AT&T will follow the lead of other companies by just depositing a bunch of cash on the hotel’s loading dock.” Stephenson added that AT&T and Time Warner were also taking the extra step of leaving tons of cash at the offices of multiple members of the president’s cabinet."

Objection,” said Eric Trump who fashioned a makeshift judge’s robe from a Dracula cape and repeatedly shouted “attorney–client privilege” while striking the top of their hastily assembled card table with an old claw hammer he’d found in a supply closet. “We got a bunch of evidence and super witnesses, so you better let our dad go before we find you in tempt [sic] of the court!

I’m sure our fans at home are especially interested in that Trump Tower meeting you just mentioned.

I hear bad things happen to people who make a habit of that sorta thing,” said the trench-coated man who complimented Giuliani on his beautiful Mercedes and remarked on how funny it is that people who drive them fancy cars seem to have a high mortality rate when they don’t act smart. “You stay off those cable news programs, see? All that high-voltage lighting equipment, all that stuff to trip over in the whaddacallit, the studio, could be a real health hazard. Nobody wants that, right? But, all due respect, Mr. Mayor, sometimes people who wonder about why Mr. Trump fired Comey and then talk about it in front of millions of Americans, well—they get preoccupied, they get so they don’t pay attention, they get in all these accidents. Hudson River’s awful cold this time of year, know what I’m sayin’?” At press time, the mysterious individual told Giuliani that he could make it up to Mr. Trump while handing the former mayor a .44 Magnum and a list of FBI agents."

Then, I acted completely alone in hiring Michael Cohen to make her sign an NDA and pay her off. I kept quiet about having had sex with Stormy Daniels—as well as any and all other women who President Trump has been unjustly accused of having affairs with—because I wanted to be the secretary of agriculture, but I can no longer keep quiet. President Trump is innocent, and it was me—me and only me—all along.

I would not characterize the FSB’s reaction as one of surprise.” Veselnitskaya confirmed that she eventually broke ties with the Trump campaign, citing concerns that the bumbling jackasses in charge would fuck up everything Russia was working towards, choosing instead to concentrate her efforts on “the ruthless Machiavellian savants” of the National Rifle Association."

This program encourages them to abstain from that behavior by focusing their eyes on safe alternatives, such as the floor, the middle distance, or a bible passage of their choosing.” Pence also promised that high school students would feel far greater satisfaction by waiting until their wedding night to learn their spouse’s eye color."

Ever since I spent the last $800,000 or so around the beginning of March, the EPA hasn’t had two nickels to rub together. Now, I’ve got all kinds of sub-departments breathing down my neck wondering where all the funding is, and I’ve just been pretending we’re solvent and trying to hide from everyone.

However, our hateful rhetoric tends to flow off the tongue a little easier, whereas Americans tend to be a bit more crass in the way they explicitly despise every member of the faith.” At press time, reports confirmed Macron was observed stifling a giggle as National Security Adviser John Bolton garishly threatened to bomb Iran during hors d’oeuvres."

The memos confirm the existence of compromising footage of Trump being sworn in as president of the United States of America.

Trump appears to be actively and consciously choosing to do the things he does and say the things he says. After a lengthy discussion, Comey and Trump agreed thatThe Florida Project’s climax was a stark departure from an otherwise nuanced portrayal of impoverished Americans.

A 55-year-old registered voter from the mid-21st century, Luke Jacobs cast his first ballots for president as a young man in 2012 and 2016 and he acknowledged that crude rhetoric and appeals to fear were rampant in those election seasons. But he said it was nothing compared to what he was now witnessing during a 2048 debate broadcast from the 130,000-square-foot stadium where leading candidates from both parties engaged in a vicious, no-holds-barred battle for the White House, mercilessly tearing each other limb from limb with clubs, chains, and knives. “The debates were hardly perfect when I was young—there was some name-calling and question-dodging—but the dialogue was a lot more civil than it is now,” said Jacobs as armor-clad Democrats and Republicans entered the pits for the first 2048 debate, which was being held before an audience that sat behind an electrified fence, chanted the candidates’ names, and urged them to slam each other into the sharpened steel spikes that line the arena’s walls. “Back then, it was still a war of words. They didn’t cut out someone’s tongue to keep them from speaking entirely. And no one delivered their opening remarks while holding aloft the severed head of a rival, later crushing it with their bare hands while emphasizing a particular point.” “This really makes me miss the 2010s,” Jacobs continued. “The first round in the Healthcare Battles is almost over, and Democrats have spent the entire time pandering to their base by disemboweling their adversaries and throwing handfuls of still-warm viscera into the cheering crowd.” According to reports from the future, Jacobs spent much of the debate explaining to his children that when he was young, the presidential debates had far more substance, and while a candidate in those days might use a two-minute time slot to tear into an opponent verbally, they would never do so physically with a meat cleaver. He added that American political discourse has eroded over the years, making it acceptable for a modern candidate like SkullCrusher (R-OR) to use his 30-second rebuttal on school funding to cut his challenger in half with a chainsaw and toss the dead body onto a pile of skeletons belonging to vanquished candidates from four years earlier. Jacobs reportedly believes much of the fault lies with the moderators, who in the past managed to ask pointed questions of candidates like Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, but are now unable to maintain order when Republican frontrunner Eagle’s Wrath and his running mate George Z. Bush impale four of their opponents at once on a flagpole they sharpened to a deadly point. However, he also blamed the questionable tactics of 2048’s White House hopefuls, citing the case of a Green Party candidate who, after being denied an invitation to the debates, charged into the pits and blew himself up with a makeshift pipe bomb. “In the 2010s, it was considered off-limits to drag an opponent’s children into the debate,” said Jacobs, watching as a 2048 candidate literally dragged an opponent’s teenage son into the debate pits and burned him alive with a flamethrower. “Now, they’ll do anything to throw a rival off his game. Sure, in the 2016 town hall debate you had Donald Trump trying to intimidate Hillary Clinton by lurking behind her as she spoke, but he certainly didn’t sneak up on her and bury an ice pick in the back of her skull. At that time, there were certain ethical lines you just didn’t cross.” Though he admitted the 2012 and 2016 debates often left him feeling exhausted by the end, Jacobs stressed that they never made him as despondent as he felt at the close of the 2048 debate, when the one remaining Democratic challenger beheaded the Republican incumbent, expertly carved his face off, pulled the bloodied mask of skin and hair over his own head, and shouted that he was now “the one true god-king of the White House.” “You know, even after the most heated, bitter debates of 2016, Trump and Clinton would still shake hands and exchange a few kind words at the end—they had that much decency, you know?” Jacobs said as paramedics finally entered the debate pit to check for signs of life among the towering mounds of human bodies. “But now, you stick out your hand and your opponent immediately rips off your arm and bludgeons you to death with it, right there on the spot. And then they unbuckle their pants and piss on your dead body. There’s absolutely zero dignity.” “I don’t know how I’m supposed to use debates like this to decide who to vote for,” Jacobs added. “I guess I’ll just pick whoever’s still alive.”"
1264,"WASHINGTON—Demanding greater accountability for the race’s outcome, the Democratic National Committee reportedly filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit Friday alleging that the nation should never, ever stop focusing on the 2016 presidential election. “Our lawsuit lays out, in no uncertain terms, that the nation should never under any circumstances move on from the 2016 election results,” said DNC chairman Tom Perez, adding that the 66-page lawsuit filed in a New York federal court asserts that the American people must remain solely preoccupied with every little goddamn detail from the 2016 presidential race. “We’re calling on WikiLeaks, Russia, and Trump campaign officials to join the Democratic Party in our efforts to spend the next several years prioritizing endless fucking discussions about potential election interference and what that means for democracy. We believe there was a deliberate effort to throw the race to Donald Trump, and that the American people have a right to publicly re-litigate Hillary Clinton’s defeat and promote far-reaching conspiracy theories instead of concentrating on anything remotely politically constructive for the next few decades at least.” At press time, DNC officials were calling for an emergency legal injunction to block the nation from learning absolutely anything from the 2016 election."
1265,"PYONGYANG—Declaring that he has “finally, at long last, come home” to a society that properly aligns with his values, former C.I.A. director and U.S. Secretary of State candidate Mike Pompeo officially defected to the totalitarian nation Thursday after learning about Kim Jong-un’s torture program. “It’s amazing—the torture here is just miles and miles ahead of what they do in the U.S.,” said Pompeo, who credited the sheer scope, creativity, and attention to detail employed in North Korea’s innovative torture techniques for inspiring his sudden defection. “They don’t mess around with that namby-pamby waterboarding stuff like we do back in the States. In North Korea, if they, I mean, if we suspect someone to be an enemy of the regime, they’re beaten half to death, thrown in a labor camp, forced to dig their own graves, then slowly crushed to death under the corpses of their families and friends. Hell, if Kim Jong-un says he doesn’t like a band’s music, the police strap the musicians across the muzzles of anti-aircraft cannons, fire off a volley, and drive tanks back and forth over the bloody gobbets. I have so much lost time to make up.” At press time, the state-run Korean Central News Agency reported that Pompeo has adjusted quickly to his new life as a North Korean citizen and has already accused several of his neighbors of high treason."
1266,"WASHINGTON—Stammering as they struggled to form an opinion about the surprising revelation, the nation’s liberals admitted Thursday they were not sure what to think after hearing U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had waterboarded every suspect in his investigation into the Trump campaign. “I’ve stood firmly in support of Mueller, believing the president must be held accountable for his severe misdeeds, but I’m also against torture, so…I think this is probably wrong? Maybe?” said left-leaning voter Gregory Topper, who at first responded with horror to news that convicted campaign advisers Paul Manafort and Michael Flynn had been repeatedly subjected to simulated drowning, but then added that the nation must do everything in its power to stop a corrupt despot like Trump—and perhaps that included waterboarding, though perhaps not. “This is an attack on our democracy, and these are clearly terrible, terrible people. Even so, we shouldn’t resort to torture, not ever. But is waterboarding even really torture? I mean, you aren’t in real physical danger. Huh. On the other hand, it’s still barbaric and inhumane, so there’s no way I can support this. Or can I?” At press time, liberals around the nation were reportedly reconsidering their opinions on extralegal detention after hearing all suspects in the Mueller investigation had been transferred to Guantánamo Bay."
1267,"WASHINGTON—Following President Trump’s decision to launch airstrikes in Syria without seeking approval from Congress, GOP lawmakers reportedly asked what they had ever done to make the commander in chief think they wouldn’t immediately knuckle under and let him bomb whomever he wishes. “Honestly, he ought to know by now that he can come to us on something like this and we’ll give him whatever he wants,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday, observing that Congress almost never fails to bow to the president’s desires, whether that means stepping aside to let his Muslim ban go forward or refusing to take up a bill that would prevent him from firing Special Counsel Robert Mueller. “Never once did we stand up to him on any of the impulsive, wildly impractical policy ideas he floats that would harm countless Americans. So what gives? He could have requested our authorization to carpet-bomb Syria, send ground troops into Iraq, or anything, really. There’s no doubt in my mind we would have caved instantly and let him have it.” A teary-eyed McConnell went on to state that he hopes Trump understands that congressional Republicans will always be there for him, no matter what’s going on, and that he can count on them to put their country second and destroy their legacies."
1268,"NEW YORK—Saying that any past interactions he’d had with the attorney were completely informal, Fox News television host Sean Hannity told reporters Tuesday that his relationship with Michael Cohen never went beyond paying him for legal advice and discussing criminal defense strategies. “Mr. Cohen is no more than an acquaintance of mine who has, on occasion, helped me plan the best course of action in legal disputes and received monetary compensation for his efforts,” said Hannity, adding that claims he was Cohen’s client are completely unfounded and that he had simply received the lawyer’s help drawing up documents to create legally binding contracts, later reimbursing him for his time. “I hardly knew the guy except for a couple of paid, friendly pointers he gave me on making lawsuits go away or destroying a potential witness’s credibility—things like that. A casual conversation about plea bargain negotiations between friends in exchange for a nominal fee is being completely blown out of proportion by the mainstream media.” Hannity went on to state that if any evidence that might incriminate him were found in Cohen’s seized files, it would constitute a huge breach of attorney-client privilege."
1269,"A new book by former FBI director James Comey,A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, And Leadership, promises to offer an inside look at his time in federal law enforcement, as well as his controversial role in the 2016 presidential election. Here are the biggest revelations from Comey’s autobiography. Believes Donald Trump may have acted inappropriately at certain points during his presidency. Five fucking chapters about his childhood and adolescence. Sees Hillary Clinton reflected back in his mirror for a split second every night while brushing his teeth. His FBI code name was “James Comey.” Fears the 2016 presidential election distracted the FBI from its real work of spying on Muslim Americans. Thinks that, while it may not have been quite as commercially successful asPurple,No. 4is still the superior Stone Temple Pilots album. Beef broth is the key to the FBI’s famous four-alarm chili recipe. Still to this day records every private conversation, just in case. All the juicy details you’d expect from someone who worked for U.S district judge John M. Walker Jr. as a law clerk in 1985. Did not do anything wrong during the 2016 presidential election."
1270,"WASHINGTON—As the U.S. military awaited a potential response to its recent series of targeted airstrikes, sources reported Monday that the Trump administration would not rule out escalating defense-sector profits from the conflict in Syria. “If [Syrian president] Bashar al-Assad decides to retaliate, we won’t hesitate to rapidly scale up the revenue that weapons manufacturers can expect to earn from military action in Syria,” said Secretary of Defense James Mattis, adding that the use of over $160 million worth of Tomahawk missiles in precision strikes over the weekend should indicate that the American private defense sector was exceptionally prepared to profit from the conflict if necessary. “Our response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria should give corporations in the military-industrial complex and their shareholders the message that we are more than ready to send the value of their stocks soaring. The U.S. armed forces will stop at nothing to ensure that companies like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Boeing, and General Dynamics remain in the black.” At press time, U.S. officials noted that if rising payments to defense companies for missiles and drones failed to deter Assad, they were open to significantly expanding the bottom line of private military contractors that supply ground troops."
1271,"WASHINGTON—Former FBI Director James Comey was reportedly shocked Monday after suddenly realizing that he wrote his forthcoming memoir,A Higher Loyalty, as a defense mechanism to subconsciously mask his true, romantic feelings for President Donald Trump. “Oh, my God, it just dawned on me, I’m head over heels in love with President Trump—he’s all I think about, every hour of every day,” said Comey, who abruptly began to comprehend that his autobiography was essentially a love letter written to the 71-year-old commander in chief. “I mean, if I didn’t really like him, I’d just be apathetic, but I’ve been completely obsessed with Donald Trump for months now. Christ, it’s all starting to make sense. The reason I was so upset when I got fired [as FBI director] was because I wouldn’t get to spend time with him anymore. I know that he’s a flawed leader, but I just want to fix him.” At press time, Trump had taken to social media and dispatched several anger-filled tweets to obscure his deep, undying affection for Comey."
1272,"WASHINGTON—Expressing their bewilderment that the former FBI director had chosen to focus on the incident in such detail, the U.S. populace was reportedly confused Friday after learning that James Comey had dedicated the entirety of his upcoming memoir,A Higher Calling, to an in-depth retelling of the Martha Stewart insider trading controversy. “I expected that the Martha Stewart thing might be briefly mentioned, but I’m more than halfway through the book and he’s still going on and on about it,” said Alyssa Cady, 34, echoing the sentiments of 323 million Americans who admitted to feeling perplexed that Comey had devoted over 300 pages to vividly recounting the prosecution of Stewart during his tenure as a U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. “There’s this part in chapter six where he starts talking about his service to the country, and I thought, ‘Good, he’s finally going to bring up the 2016 election,’ but he just launches into a diatribe about how we must be vigilant against those who would violate the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. And I was pretty annoyed when ‘the biggest showdown of my career’ ended up being about nailing Martha Stewart for perjury.” Cady confirmed that the only mention of Donald Trump in the entire book was a passing reference during a chapter in which Comey expresses the vindication he felt after Martha Stewart’s 2005 spin-off ofThe Apprenticewas cancelled."
1273,"WASHINGTON—Expressing surprise at the relatively tame treatment he had received during his confirmation hearing, Secretary of State nominee Mike Pompeo told reporters Thursday that he can’t believe the Senate expected him to give answers without even being tortured first. “I thought I was supposed to be grilled on my policy positions here, but they just let me sit in this cushy chair the whole time without waterboarding me or anything,” said the CIA director, shaking his head in disbelief as he noted that the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee had simply asked him to clarify his stance on Russia without once putting him in an agonizing stress position, threatening the lives of his family, or stripping him naked and forcing him to crawl on a leash through the Capitol Building lobby. “I was already kind of skeptical when they let me get a full night’s sleep last night without once waking me up by blaring heavy metal. But does Tim Kaine seriously think I’m going to give him any dirt on my views on North Korean regime change if he doesn’t at least snuff out a cigarette on my testicles? Come on, get real.” At press time, Pompeo had perked up as Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) mentioned “rectal feeding tubes” before realizing in disappointment that it was just another routine committee question."
1274,"WASHINGTON—Cutting the commander-in-chief off mid-sentence and demanding that he give them a straight answer, U.S. General Paul Selva reportedly snapped “Look, just tell us who to kill” Thursday as President Donald Trump entered the 20th minute of a rambling answer about what to do in Syria. “With all due respect, Mr. President, just shut the fuck up and let us know who to bomb,” said Selva, echoing the sentiments of several generals gathered at an intelligence meeting, all of whom had grown more frustrated as the president spoke in circles and offered increasingly vague ideas for potential military actions in Syria. “Stop this meandering bullshit and give us a clear indication of who we should blow up. For Christ’s sake, all we need is a word. Assad. Iran. Russia. Whoever the hell you want, and we’ll go kill them. Just tell us whether you want a few people dead or a lot of people dead, and we’ll figure out all the details, okay? Jesus, this was so much easier with Bush.” At press time, the aggravated generals had gotten up and left the room while Trump was still talking and mutually decided to just bomb everywhere they thought ISIS could be."
1275,"WASHINGTON—Stressing the importance of thinking long and hard about what a scandal like that could do to his career, White House aides spent hours Thursday trying to talk Donald Trump out of sending associates to break into the Watergate office complex. “Mr. President, I don’t think anyone from the DNC has worked there in decades, and even if they did, now might not be the best time to do something like that,” said White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, who was joined by several top advisors in telling Trump that, although the idea was interesting, he might want to consider holding off on sending five men to trespass on private property and set up wiretaps in the Watergate offices. “Sir, I hate the Democrats as much as anyone, but I can’t in good conscience say that having your associates disguise themselves as Cuban Freedom Fighters, bug several phones, and then orchestrate an elaborate cover-up is something I would recommend. Also, with all due respect, President Trump, I think an academic publishing company works there now.” At press time, Kelly and his fellow aides were reportedly urging the 45th President of the United States not to tamper with any tapes he’d recorded about a potential DNC break-in."
1276,"WASHINGTON—Making it clear that they are fully prepared to use every means at their disposal to stand up against rival foreign powers, Donald Jr. and Eric Trump announced Thursday that if Russia continues to provoke the United States, they will not hesitate to egg targets in Moscow. “We like those guys, but make no mistake—if they push us too far, we’re gonna unload on them with everything we’ve got,” said Eric, who filled a duffel bag with five cartons of eggs, a pack of toilet paper, and several cans of Silly String, while Donald Jr. mapped out exactly which stretch of the Kremlin’s gardens would be best to fill with hundreds of plastic forks. “We’re not about to stand by and let Russia get away with saying a bunch of bad stuff about the greatest America on earth. We’ll see who’s still talking a big game about Syria when there’s shoe polish all over their car windows and a giant penis drawn in shaving cream on their driveway. Believe me, that stuff takes forever to clean up.” At press time, White House sources confirmed the brothers were soaked with their own urine after attempting to simultaneously piss into the same water balloon."
1277,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to calm the uneasy tech mogul’s nerves during his congressional hearing Wednesday, members of the U.S. House of Representatives reassured Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg that they weren’t actually going to be doing anything about any of this. “Mr. Zuckerberg, the members of this committee have noticed you seem a little bit anxious today, so we just want to make sure you understand this is the last time you’ll ever have to deal with these kinds of questions,” said Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-OR), urging the 33-year-old billionaire not to sweat it, as his testimony was a mere formality that would by no means lead to any new laws or regulations governing his industry. “We just need to pretend like we’re doing something right now, due to the fact that people are pretty mad at you. But once the heat dies down, you can go right back to whatever it was you were doing all along. Seriously, you can relax. Oil executives, big bank CEOs—they’ve all been in that chair before and have come out totally fine. You have absolutely no reason to worry.” Several members of Congress went on to tell Zuckerberg there’s even a chance they could work together in the future on crafting legislation."
1278,"WASHINGTON—Taking full responsibility for the major oversight, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized in his testimony to the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday for not realizing the full scope of his genius. “At the time, I thought I was only making a simple tool to connect people and was completely unaware that my brilliance had the capability of creating something that would so dramatically reshape all of society, and for that I am truly sorry,” said Zuckerberg, adding that he was to blame for not anticipating the incredible depths of his own intellectual power from which his $500 billion brainchild sprung, transforming all areas of media, communication, business, and politics, globally and forever. “Were there signs I had the visionary potential to completely change the way humans interact and turn multiple industries on their heads? Sure, but I did not foresee the extent to which my immense skill and talent would make me the most important human being in modern history, and that’s on me.” Zuckerberg promised the committee that in the future, he would be more careful by assuming that every step he took would have acclaimed, revolutionary consequences."
1279,"WASHINGTON—Repeatedly hitting the tech CEO with questions about his social media site’s methodology, members of Congress demanded Wednesday that Mark Zuckerberg tell them exactly how Facebook got people to give up their civil liberties without a fight. “Mr. Zuckerberg, please explain in detail how you convinced people to voluntarily disclose their location, personal relationships, and interests without anyone protesting you,” said Rep. G.K. Butterfield (D-NC), echoing concerns of members from both parties on the House Energy and Commerce Committee as they sought to understand the means by which Zuckerberg was able to convince more than half of all Americans to relinquish their personal privacy with virtually no argument. “We want to make sure we have this right: Even after you admitted that your site sold people’s information for profit, could be manipulated to infringe on press freedom, and even convinced people who to vote for, there wasn’t much backlash at all? Could you just outline for us precisely how you can coerce people into believing what you want them to believe without arousing much suspicion or making them mad? Thank you.” At press time, Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) was asking Zuckerberg to walk Congress through how they could make the Patriot Act into a social media site."
1280,"WASHINGTON—Realizing this thing might go a whole lot higher than anyone had imagined, Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly grew pale Tuesday, the blood draining from his face, as he discovered his Russia investigation might lead all the way to the White House. “No, no, no, that can’t be right, because if that’s right, then we’re dealing with someone who could, at this very moment, be sitting in the Oval Office,” a trembling Mueller said as he grabbed an evidence folder from his desk and began to tack up photos of campaign associates, Russian oligarchs, and others accused of interference in the 2016 election, stopping to draw a large question mark on the only individual who could connect them all. “Dear God. I knew I was on to something big, but I didn’t know it wasthisbig. Everyone on my team, all my prosecutors—I just hope I can trust them. Because this case points to one place, and one place only: The very top.” At press time, sources confirmed the former FBI director had looked out the window at the White House, drawn the blinds, searched his office for listening devices, and vomited into a trash can."
1281,"NEW YORK—Admitting they could not deny themselves a chance to glimpse a genius in action, FBI officials confirmed they raided the office of President Trump’s longtime lawyer Michael Cohen Monday so they could develop a deeper appreciation of his masterful legal work. “Yesterday afternoon, federal agents confiscated thousands of documents from Mr. Cohen in order to develop a better understanding of this consummate authority on the law by witnessing firsthand his subtle interpretive powers as an attorney,” said agency spokesperson Laura Milford, who added that the FBI immediately pored over Cohen’s meticulous, well-reasoned legal briefs, hoping to observe how the mind of such a great and conscientious professional operates. “It has been stunning to witness how he handles the president’s legal matters with both a commanding knowledge of the justice system and a passionate respect for the philosophical intricacies of jurisprudence. We couldn’t help but obtain a warrant to remove these papers and see what might be learned from the endeavors of such a highly principled individual.” The raid follows a similar operation conducted last year at Paul Manafort’s home, where the FBI seized material they hoped would allow them to see how a profound champion of global democracy goes about his work."
1282,"WASHINGTON—As he began his tenure serving as President Trump’s national security advisor, John Bolton reportedly arrived in the White House Tuesday excited to see so many familiar wars. “Afghanistan and Iraq are still here? Man, things haven’t changed a bit,” said a thrilled Bolton while making the rounds in the West Wing, adding how happy he was to see so many military conflicts he recognized from his time serving in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush administrations. “Wow, I can’t believe how many of the old War on Terror military campaigns are still around—Northwest Pakistan, Somalia, Libya—great to see them all. And Yemen was barely even a conflict when I was last here, and now it’s really come into its own. There are a few promising hostilities I haven’t become acquainted with that I’ve been hearing good things about, too, but overall, it feels like I can just pick up right where I left off.” Bolton added that he was also excited to bring a few new wars aboard, mentioning North Korea, Iran, and Turkey as conflicts he wanted to work with."
1283,"WASHINGTON—Expressing outrage at the crude, depraved perennials throughout the nation’s capitol, Vice President Mike Pence was reportedly horrified Tuesday by the D.C. cherry trees flagrantly displaying their reproductive organs for all to see. “Oh, no, this is completely disgusting,” said a visibly agitated Pence, who rushed around urging nearby pedestrians to keep their heads bowed so as to avoid catching a glimpse of the exhibitionistic flora. “How are we supposed to get anything done with these perverted saplings waving their stamens around without any regard for decency? I understand that these trees need to reproduce, but it should be a private matter between a plant and its pollinator, not something that good, upstanding D.C. residents should be forced to endure. I’m afraid to say that these sick, pornographic displays in areas frequented by women and children serve as yet another troubling example of our country turning away from traditional family values.” At press time, Pence was reportedly comforted by the knowledge that before long, his administration’s environmental policies would put a stop to these trees’ licentious behavior."
1284,"WASHINGTON—Waking in the same bleary-eyed state of confusion as he has every day of his Presidency, Donald Trump blinked at his unfamiliar surroundings and slowly shook his head several times before finding and reading the phrase, “You are Donald Trump, 45th president of the United States,” from a faded tattoo on his wrist this morning, White House sources confirmed. “You are commander in chief of the armed forces, you are a Republican, and your current wife’s name is Melania,” said a bleary, shirtless Trump, standing in front of a mirror and reading those words, as well as “Remember: Argue for immigration shutdown” and “Attack biased media,” from his completely ink-covered chest. “Rules for press conferences: evade criticisms by mentioning Hillary Clinton; smear protesters; Russia probe is witch hunt. Stephen M. and John K. are friends. All others may be dismissed/thrown under bus as necessary.” At press time, a glimmer of recognition could be seen in Trump’s eyes as he viewed a VHS tape he found on his dresser labeled “Good morning, Donald: Watch this,” which carefully detailed the 2016 election numbers and inauguration crowd size."
1285,"STANFORD, CA—Saying representatives and senators alike must find time to usher their constituents out of their lonely, dark isolation with the guiding light of an elected official’s love, a study released Thursday by Stanford University revealed that 93 percent of Americans don’t truly know their congressperson, not utterly, not in the way only two souls entwined can be known to one another. “According to a comprehensive survey conducted in districts across the country, less than 10 percent of voters feel their bond with any of their congressional representatives has been tempered in passion’s forge, shaped and molded by forces so intense as to meld their souls into a singular, eternal being, transcendent and pure,” wrote head researcher Lawrence Fekmule in the study, which found that the vast majority of voters were unable to even guess at the deepest desires locked, smoldering liked baked coals, dormant in their legislators’ hearts, waiting only to be sparked into light and heat—ferocious, insistent, all-consuming heat—by a connection with their constituency so profound and absolute and, yes, soright, that everything else ceases to matter or even exist except for that true fire. “When going to the polls, it’s unlikely that voters will have made an effort to speak with their candidate—actually speak, you know, talking to them for hours on end, until it’s so late it’s early, and dinner has somehow become breakfast, and they should be tired, but really, staying up together is better than sleep, better than anything. Why go to bed, or really, why go anywhere when you can go to a town hall, look your congressperson in the eyes, and become lost as a rush of pure wonder draws you into a union that transcends space and time?” Fekmule added that, sadly, the encroaching influence of Washington’s special interests made it increasingly likely that American voters will forever wander in the cold desolation of their own inner night, forever searching in that dry, bitter darkness for a relationship with their congressperson that can never be."
1286,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to guarantee Americans the freedom to pick whichever mode of rapid ecological decay they desire, the Environmental Protection Agency rolled back federal emissions standards Friday to provide consumers with a broader choice over the type of apocalyptic hellscape Earth will inevitably become. “Bleak, post-industrial garbage desert, nightmarish inferno of eternal noxious flames, or glowing green toxic acid swamp—no matter which unsurvivable wasteland you favor, eliminating fuel economy and automotive emissions standards will provide car buyers far more options as to how their imminent dystopias will look,” said EPA chief Scott Pruitt, who said current burdensome auto industry regulations unfairly limit consumer choices between the human race dying in uninhabitable stretches of desert as far as the eye can see, drowning in an unending series of massive tsunamis, or slowly degrading into a genetically corrupt pseudo-race dwelling in cities overrun by half-human mutant predators. “While some people want a world where every man, woman, and child on the planet dissolves to the bone within seconds of being exposed to a corrosive atmosphere, others prefer Earth to become a land ruled by leather-clad warlords leading tribes of diseased and malnourished warriors into battle over the last few remaining drops of petroleum. The decision of how to best leave the planet a charred and blackened husk must be made by the American people and not the federal government.” According to sources, a protesting California is expected to stick with stricter standards, thereby restricting consumers to choose between a few basic hellscapes shrouded beneath jet-black clouds of poisonous exhaust."
1287,"WASHINGTON—In the latest shakeup to their defense of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia probe, President Trump’s legal team reportedly welcomed Wednesday a guy who never missed an episode ofAlly McBealback in the day. “We’re excited today to be joined by Ron Farkus, an Ohio man who tuned in every week between 1997 and 2002 to watch Fox’s beloved Calista Flockhart vehicle about the eccentric and oversexed Boston law firm Cage and Fish,” said top Trump lawyer Ty Cobb, adding that the 43-year-old Farkus has years of valuable experience owning the legal comedy-drama television series’ DVD box set, watching every episode “a bunch of times,” and even memorizing several of Flockhart’s famous quips from the show. “We look forward to working with Mr. Farkus, whose expertise in the antics of Ally, Richard, and Elaine both in and out of the courthouse will be of great use to us, as will his intimate knowledge of the ensemble’s ever-shifting love triangles, their outlandish courtroom battles, and the recurring dancing babies.” At press time, Farkus had been let go and replaced by a man who’s seen every episode of USA’sSuits, moments before that individual lost his position to some dude who used to watch the CBS legal dramaJAGpretty regularly."
1288,"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging that total war with a personality cult ruled by a nuclear-capable despot will be a harrowing commitment posing many unique challenges, newly appointed National Security Advisor John Bolton promised the American public Friday that the upcoming war with North Korea certainly won’t be a cakewalk like Iraq. “You have to admit, things in Iraq were pretty cut-and-dried—we went in there, we deposed the leader, we installed our own government, we never even had to think about the long-term consequences, and certainly no hordes of soldiers were forced to fight the tens of thousands of American teens we’re going to throw at them in great, meat-grinding, human-wave attacks like we’re about to see in North Korea,” said Bolton, who noted that as one of the architects of the “ultimately painless and remarkably successful” 2003 Iraq invasion, he knew what he was talking about when it came to planning a massive land campaign in Asia. “It’s a good thing we have regional, expendable allies, because after the first 90 minutes of this war, somewhere around 2 million South Koreans are going to be a thin layer of greasy soot in the stratosphere, if my plan goes correctly. Then we simply commit an entire generation of young Americans to dying in numbers so great that they will permanently change the geography of the Korean peninsula. As will North Korea’s nukes and our fission weapons, of course. Believe me, this war is going to be an absolute mess.” Bolton also warned that further delays in mobilizing for war with North Korea would inevitably push back the start of the U.S.’s upcoming war with Iran."
1289,"WASHINGTON—Gently placing his hand on the small of Jared Kushner’s back, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman applied only the gentlest of pressure—no more than a petal falling to the surface of a fountain—and in a voice heavy with anticipation, whispered “You are the jewel of my collection,” thus guiding his frightened new prize toward his harem, royal sources confirmed Thursday. “Once we reach my palace and you pass through the secret doors of scarlet silk, your former life’s tribulations and entanglements shall fade, and you shall live to serve me and me alone—this I swear to you, most precious and delicate Jared, that you will want for nothing,” said bin Salman, collapsing onto a velvet fainting couch as his concubines adorned the White House senior advisor in sheer yet elegant robes and anointed his skin with rosewater. “Do not tremble, my doe; my lamb; my delicate bird. The inevitable is nothing to fear, and already your soft features and perfect alabaster skin have set you in a high place among the most cherished of all my playthings. Come to me, so that I may drink deep of the wonder and spectacle that is my Jared Kushner.” At press time, Kushner, now shirtless and moving as one in a waking dream, had draped himself along a sumptuous bed of pillows and closed his heavy eyes, his mind escaping on the rivulets of gentle music played on an unseen lute."
1290,"THE REALM OF MISDOING—Cackling with glee while observing the turmoil brought about by his consternating ways, enchanted goblin Grumblethor the Mischievous—creator of the world’s chaos and confusion—revealed Wednesday that he is pleased with the mayhem his magical antics have wrought upon White House–FBI relations. “Look at the halfwits in Washington as they fall under my bewitching spell, sniping at each other like the hapless fools they are—Oh, it has all been so devilishly simple!” said the Lord of Mischief and Mayhem, peering into his smoke-filled Globe of Deceit with visible delight as resentful tweets appeared from Andrew McCabe, Donald Trump, John O. Brennan, and James Comey, among others. “Soon, I will befuddle the dunces in the Supreme Court into posting Facebook statuses about their anger toward Congress, and so Grumblethor’s diabolical plans will come to fruition! Fye-dee-dee, dum-dee-dee, another triumph for rascally me!” At press time, Grumblethor was seen cantering in joy through his Cavern of Disorder after a minion brought word that millions of Americans believed that a “deep state” in the government pulled levers behind the scenes."
1291,"WASHINGTON—Tears welling in their eyes as they faced each other while standing at attention, the Trump boys, Donald Jr. and Eric, exchanged a solemn salute before defiantly leaping from a first-story White House window. “It’s been an honor to serve with you, Don,” said a stoic Eric Trump who opened the window in the State Dining Room in preparation for the brothers’ last great act of glorious rebellion. “Don’t cry, Don, today we are going to bravely escape to heaven. I’ll meet at the pearly gates. Just look for someone who looks exactly like me yelling your name.” White House tour sources confirmed hearing the Trump boys screaming incoherently after the brothers leaped out the opening, fell 18 inches, and became entangled in coniferous shrubs."
1292,"A growing ideological divide and the retirements of a number of longstanding governors and members of Congress are contributing to a wide-open and contentious primary season.The Onionoutlines some of the most important primary elections taking place this spring and summer. Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District (March 20):Many congressional Democrats have refused to endorse incumbent Rep. Dan Lipinski, in a departure from the tradition of blindly supporting the most conservative members of their party for no real reason. West Virginia Senate, Republican Party (May 8):Candidate Don Blankenship, former Massey Energy CEO, has vowed to use his experience permitting conditions that kill coal miners to bring the most unsafe, potentially lethal coal-mining jobs back to the state. Ohio Governor (May 8):You’d probably have a pretty decent chance at winning this one if you want to give it a shot. Georgia Governor, Democratic Party (May 22):Democrats are hopeful that the political climate and Trump presidency mean that the state is finally ready for a moderately conservative leader. Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District (May 22):Three Democrats—Jim Gray, a gay construction magnate; Amy McGrath, a female Marine fighter jet pilot; and Reggie Thomas, a progressive African-American law professor—vie to win the congressional seat and the right to become the subject of a future biopic. California Jungle Primaries (June 5):California could bridge the Democrat-Republican divide, as the state’s nontraditional system means the top two candidates from the primaries will be wed regardless of party affiliation. Virginia Senate (June 12):If he wins the GOP nomination, E.W. Jackson, a man who believes yoga leads to Satan and that gay people are sick, would be an entertaining candidate for Democratic senator Tim Kaine to struggle to defeat in a debate. Arizona Senate (August 28):Republican candidate Joe Arpaio will test whether Americans are willing to elect a man with controversial views on immigration to higher office. Florida Governor (August 28):One balls-to-the-wall gator-rasslin’ match, winner take all."
1293,"WASHINGTON—Wearing a double-breasted tuxedo vest and black bowtie while sitting next to the sinks in the U.S. Capitol men’s room, recently-fired FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe reportedly plans to spend the next three days as a congressional bathroom attendant to satisfy his pension requirements, sources confirmed Monday. “Senator Cruz, looking very sharp today, sir—Can I offer you anything? Hot towel? Breath mint?” said the former senior intelligence official, rising from a tall wooden stool, unfolding a white handkerchief, and displaying a rolling suitcase containing an array of colognes, mouthwash, and chewing gum before turning to greet a congressman hurrying into a nearby stall. “Let me get that hot water going for you, Mr. Burr. By the way, how’s the probe going? Ha-ha, very good, sir. And you have a very nice day.” At press time, McCabe had taken a break from scrubbing urinals in order to count up the nearly $4.50 in tips he had made over the course of the day."
1294,"WASHINGTON—Admitting that his competitive spirit got the best of him, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry apologized Friday for trying to outdo his fellow cabinet members by spending $72 million of taxpayer money on a lampshade. “I deeply and sincerely regret becoming swept up in the office-decorating fervor of my colleagues and subsequently allocating over $70 million of my department’s budget for this lampshade,” said Perry, who admitted he ordered the shade from an antiques agent in Paris’ Porte de Clignancourt district to impress other cabinet members after seeing Ryan Zinke’s cocobolo-and-stingray-leather office door and the lavish Moroccan tapestries hung throughout the waiting area of Ben Carson’s “Desert Caravan”-themed office. “American citizens should not have to shoulder the cost of paying for a lampshade woven from vucana silk, hand-stitched with contrasting saffron-spider thread, and crowned by the world’s seventh-largest ruby, so I will be returning the lampshade in its lacquered presentation box as soon as a Learjet can be chartered to convey it.” Despite parting with the lampshade, Perry will keep the the lamp itself, which his grandfather fashioned from a football-shaped Jim Beam decanter commemorating the 1964 Cotton Bowl."
1295,"WASHINGTON—Lamenting that even the purest hearts were fated to be broken, the confused and anguished U.S. populace was struggling Friday with the question of why bad things happen to good people following the news that Vanessa Trump filed for divorce from Donald Trump Jr. earlier this week. “How could this happen to our Don, sweet Don Jr., of all people? He’s kind, thoughtful, warm, caring, and compassionate—He doesn’t deserve this,” said the visibly distressed nation, wiping away hot tears brought on by contemplating the fundamental injustice of a world in which ill fortune befalls those who love so completely and selflessly. “This is such a blow to that whole generous, caring family, those angels dwelling among us, those who gave themselves to us all and asked for nothing in return. The searing pain of heartbreak must be a thousand times worse for hearts as pure as Don’s and Vanessa’s. If only we could take their agonies upon ourselves and spare the Trumps this soul-deep anguish!” As of press time, the saddened American populace had let the couple know they were there for them if needed, just as Don Jr. and Vanessa had always been for them."
1296,"NEW YORK—Saying they are beginning to perceive the full scope of the secretive business dealings, investigators working for special counsel Robert Mueller announced Friday that subpoenaed Trump Organization financial records show the company’s only discrete holding is a Dairy Queen franchise in West Milford, NJ. “We are currently engaged in a thorough analysis of financial statements, relinquished in response to the subpoena, encompassing the entire Trump Organization’s business empire, namely the Dairy Queen just down Marshall Hill Road from the paintball supply shop,” said agent Maria Russo, explaining that the last 30 years of President Trump’s business career appear to have been spent running the franchise, and that all his investments, accrued debt, and total net worth are tied up in the ownership of the suburban ice cream stand. “As we understand it so far, the day-to-day work of all 20,000 Trump employees worldwide, including the thousands working at the company’s rented headquarters in Trump Tower, is singularly devoted to the management and promotion of this Dairy Queen franchise. We are also in possession of tax records indicating Trump did briefly own a minor share of a Pizza Hut on Long Island, but it apparently went bankrupt in 1997.” Russo also said that the investigation had not yet turned up definitive links to Russian money, but noted the job description for the Dairy Queen night manager included “at least three ‘ruble runs’ a week” to the currency exchange at the Newark Airport."
1297,"WASHINGTON—In the hours after subpoenaing the Trump Organization for a wide-ranging batch of files possibly germane to the investigation, sources confirmed Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was already exhausted trying to find Russia-related documents amid thousands of harassment lawsuits. “Oh my god, how many of these could there possibly be?” said a visibly weary Mueller, shoving aside another stack of papers containing only a single email exchange between a Trump Organization employee and a Russian businessman amongst dozens of out-of-court settlements of sexual misconduct suits filed against Trump. “I thought I was finally done with all of the lawsuits women have filed against him after the reams of documents concerning the Jill Harth sexual harassment case, but no—Here’s another stack from the [Summer] Zervos defamation suit. If I keep having to rifle through tens of thousands of pages of victim statements regarding suggestive remarks, corroborating eyewitness accounts of unwelcome contact, and lists of times that Trump slandered his accusers, all to find one damn thing I can use in my investigation, this is going to take forever.” Mueller admitted he was concerned about being thrown completely off the trail after going through eight straight file boxes of sexual harassment complaints filed by Trump Organization employees alone."
1298,"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging the gender discrimination she faced in her field before receiving President Trump’s nomination to become the first female director of the CIA, career intelligence officer Gina Haspel recalled Tuesday having to torture many more prisoners than her male colleagues to prove herself. “For a long time, no one would take me seriously even though I was abusing twice as many detainees and employing far crueler methods than most of the men I worked with,” said Haspel, the current CIA deputy director, adding that her work overseeing the “Cat’s Eye” secret prison in Thailand in the early 2000s proved she could run an extralegal black site just as well as any man. “It was really frustrating how I’d have to continually come up with more innovative and brutal ways to torture high-value assets just to receive the slightest bit of recognition from my superiors, whereas the men who held the same position as me could just coast by on the same old sensory-deprivation techniques. I mean, I had to waterboard one suspected al-Qaeda member 83 times in a single month until he lost an eye—you think any of my male coworkers had to work that hard to get ahead? When you’re a woman, they never fully appreciate the things you do for them. It doesn’t matter how many videotapes of illegal torture you help destroy on the CIA’s behalf.” Haspel added that she hoped her promotion would help usher in a new age where there were more women like her in power."
1299,"WASHINGTON—Jotting down a few thoughts in order to help his replacement hit the ground running, departing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson reportedly shot Mike Pompeo a quick email Tuesday to help get him up to speed on all the countries. “Hey Mike, just wanted to give you a brief rundown on the nations of the Earth before I head out,” read Tillerson’s email, which then proceeded to list, in no particular order, the 206 countries of the world, along with brief, often one-word descriptions for each. “Mexico: Spanish-speaking nation on southern border that doesn’t like walls; Australia: big island with kangaroos and no guns; China: communists, trading partner, we owe them lots of money; Nigeria: hot; Saudi Arabia: fantastic; South Korea: ???” Sources confirmed Tillerson concluded his email by saying there was no need to stress out about remembering everything on the list, as he hadn’t found it necessary to know all that much about the countries and Pompeo probably wouldn’t either."
1300,"WASHINGTON—Saying the administration would not tolerate such egregious behavior from an official in his capacity, the White House confirmed Tuesday that outgoing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had been fired for inappropriately weighing in on international politics. “Mr. Tillerson was well aware of what we expected from him as the nation’s chief diplomat, and therefore should have known better than to give his opinions on a foreign policy matter,” read the statement from the White House, citing Tillerson’s public condemnation of Russia for its likely involvement in a nerve agent attack in the U.K. as “completely out of line” and “inconsistent with the current administration’s understanding of his duties.” “By assessing an international situation between allies and voicing his perspective as head of the State Department, Mr. Tillerson completely overstepped his jurisdiction. This administration’s firm stance against this kind of overreach by senior diplomatic advisers led President Trump to act swiftly and remove Mr. Tillerson from his position.” At press time, Trump was praising his new nominee for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, for his strong commitment to diplomacy within the boundaries of what the president will allow."
1301,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that there was no one-size-fits-all solution to the problem, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos reportedly argued Monday that the issue of guns in schools should be fully left up to the individual shooters. “It’s not the role of the federal government to step in and dictate whether firearms in the classroom are the right choice for any one specific shooter,” said DeVos, who told reporters that every shooter is different and that it should be in their hands to decide how much training they need and what sort of weapon they should carry. “It makes sense that a shooter in rural Iowa is going to require a different setup than a shooter in the middle of Atlanta. Instead of trying to solve this with an overly broad and ineffective mandate, we need to be making decisions on a shooter-by-shooter basis.” DeVos added that she believes strongly in this policy, as it has already proven successful with shooters across the country."
1302,"WASHINGTON—Shaking himself back to consciousness and cardiopulmonary function following a momentary lapse in personal viability, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross apologized to the other cabinet members after briefly dying during a meeting on steel tariffs Friday. “Whoops, sorry about that—just walked towards the light for a second,” said Ross, blinking rapidly as his neurons resumed firing and his soul settled back into its vessel of flesh following his latest brush with eternity. “Sorry, folks, all brain function just sort of ceased there and I briefly beheld the sight of my dead loved ones beckoning to me from the far side of the gate to the night country. What’d I miss?” Sources confirmed that Ross’ colleagues have previously expressed their annoyance at the secretary’s brushes with mortality, claiming they find themselves distracted by his loud and frequent death rattles."
1303,"WASHINGTON—Complaining that U.S. investigations into foreign interference in the election have gotten almost everything wrong, officials from dozens of countries around the world expressed irritation Friday that all of the credit for meddling in the 2016 presidential race was going to Russia. Resentful operatives from Serbia, Uruguay, Swaziland, and 45 other nations said they were incredibly annoyed that Kremlin-backed computer hackers and dark-money financiers were receiving all the media attention, while their own far superior efforts to undermine the U.S. electoral process had so far received no recognition at all. “Do you haveanyidea how much more sophisticated our attacks on American democracy were than Russia’s?” Laotian president Bounnhang Vorachith said of his government’s efforts to spread misinformation about Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton on social media sites. “We spent millions building a sophisticated bot network that could craft false but believable stories portraying Trump in a good light. And it worked! It’s unbelievably frustrating to pull off something like that and then have all the glory go to someone else.” “Do you really think Russia could’ve hacked into [Clinton campaign chairman] John Podesta’s emails?” Vorachith continued. “Hell no. That was Laos.” According to sources, every time the American media credits Russian oligarchs with funding election-tampering efforts, numerous foreign agents across the globe throw up their arms and storm out of the room, infuriated because Costa Rican and Nepalese money launderers reportedly did far more to finance such initiatives. These agents have also been known to toss aside newspapers in anger, shouting that Mongolia’s work busing thousands of people with dead voters’ names to cast ballots for Clinton in New Hampshire was more deserving of attention than anything Russia had accomplished. In addition, reports confirmed that scores of world leaders fly into a rage whenever members of Congress express grave concern over Russian president Vladimir Putin’s 2016 machinations but make no mention of anyone else’s schemes. “Russia had a bunch of scrubs sitting in some warehouse putting out piddly-shit Facebook posts while we were actually purging voter rolls in over a dozen states, and yet no one’s callingusan enemy of democracy?” said Gambian operative Ndura Sanneh, remarking that the ninth-largest country in the world impacting a U.S. election wasn’t nearly as impressive as the 146th most populous nation doing it. “It’s such bullshit. We fed that ‘build the wall’ line to the Trump campaign three years ago, and it’d be nice to get some goddamn acknowledgment for it. But with the Russians grabbing all the headlines, how can we?” “The biased coverage is completely disrespectful,” she added. “It’s as if these American newspapers don’t even realize Jill Stein is a Gambian asset.” Meanwhile, undercover agents from the island nation of Tuvalu were reportedly “climbing the walls,” upset they had achieved no notoriety despite successfully exploiting the growing political polarization in the United States with their clandestine planning of the 2017 Women’s March. And exasperated leaders in St. Kitts and Nevis—who claimed that without their onsite voter-intimidation tactics, Clinton could never have won Virginia or Minnesota—said the lack of attention given to their country’s efforts was enough to make them contemplate getting out of the election-rigging game altogether. Throughout the international community, many leaders expressed similar sentiments. “In 2016, we managed to shake Americans’ faith in their political institutions to its core, and yet there’s still no one hysterically calling for sanctions against us,” German chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters. “It pisses me off that Russia got started at the last minute, copied everyone else’s ideas, and then got all the recognition for sticking America with President Trump.” “I guess this is what we get for actually being discreet about our interference, unlike the Russians, who were literally stupid enough to let one of their operatives meet with the Trump campaign inside Trump Tower,” she continued. “They’ll probably hog the spotlight after the 2020 election, too.”"
1304,"WASHINGTON—Urging journalists not to fixate on specious rumors and instead pursue topics of real importance, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders warned reporters assembled for the press briefing Thursday that allegations of President Trump’s affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels were a steamy, sexy distraction from the real issues. “Look, I know how easy it is to get all hot and bothered while reading these tantalizing stories about the president, but Americans need to focus on the concrete problems affecting our nation,” said a sweaty, visibly aroused Huckabee Sanders, who flushed noticeably and bit her bottom lip as she encouraged reporters to concentrate on the issues concerning everyday citizens instead of whatever filthy, animalistic sexual acts may or may not have occurred during a hedonistic weekend in Beverly Hills. “Journalists should be reporting on the decreasing unemployment rate and the return of manufacturing jobs, not the president’s engorged genitals or the intoxicating idea of two people in a five-star Lake Tahoe hotel room tonguing honey from each other’s secret places during an illicit tryst. However titillating they might be, these rumors are just a diversion from the hard, sweaty work of helping the American worker onto his back. Back on his feet.” Huckabee Sanders then apologized for emptying a pitcher of ice water over her head during her presentation, excused herself, and staggered moaning from the briefing room."
1305,"WASHINGTON—In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that left 17 dead and 14 injured, sources confirmed Wednesday that the idea of doing absolutely nothing until the next mass shooting is gaining considerable traction in Congress. “After the recent tragedies, lawmakers have shown a great deal of interest in a proposal that’s been circulating to sit back and do jack shit until the next entirely preventable massacre goes down on U.S. soil,” sources said of the legislators’ plan to twiddle their thumbs while the next unhinged lunatic effortlessly purchases an AR-15 before firing it indiscriminately in what could be either a crowded mall, a movie theater, an airport, or even another school. “As soon as the Parkland shooting happened, party leaders banded together, declared ‘Enough is enough,’ and immediately began formulating a way to talk out of their asses via their social media accounts while doing nothing to create, strengthen, or better enforce basic gun laws. This measure to squander their unique opportunity to pass legislation that puts an end to the maddening cycle of gun violence is very popular right now, and will likely continue to be championed until the next group of innocent men, women, and children are brutally slaughtered.” Sources added that the plan has a high chance of surviving, as it has the full support of the NRA."
1306,"WASHINGTON—Finding it difficult to refrain from basic human compassion and instead make everything about himself in the face of horrible tragedy, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly struggled Friday to maintain a believable Trump impression during phone calls with the teenage survivors of the mass shooting in Parkland, FL, administration sources confirmed. “This was a bad dude, a really bad dude, and, uh, we’re going to win, and it’s going to be unbelievable,” said the retired four-star Marine Corps general whose adherence to Trump’s unrefined speech patterns, 160-word vocabulary, and erratic vocal cadence was undercut by his inability to fully capture the commander in chief’s meandering, self-centered arrogance. “My heart truly breaks for you and all who have suffered—uh, no, I mean—what a huge thrill it must be for you to get to talk to me.” The Parkland survivors later indicated that Kelly’s refusal to voice any commitment for gun control measures had successfully convinced them they were indeed speaking to the president."
1307,"WASHINGTON—Saying the CNN town hall debate had left him sexually aroused in a way he hadn’t experienced since his failed 2016 presidential run, Florida senator Marco Rubio admitted Friday that he was still rock-hard a couple days after being publicly humiliated on the national stage. “Oh, fuck yes, I had forgotten how good it hurts to be degraded on live television for everyone to see,” said Rubio, noting that the Parkland shooting survivors taking him to task for his complicity combined with the booing crowd gave him a raging erection more turgid than the one he had when Chris Christie totally destroyed him during a Republican debate two years ago. “It was so intense when those town hall participants asked me to stop accepting donations from the NRA and I just squirmed around like the naughty boy I am. Then when Jake Tapper told everyone to settle down, I just about creamed my pants right there on stage. Mmm, I bet Americans are so disgusted with me. Jesus, I think I’m gonna blow a load.” Rubio added that if the survivors don’t stop roasting him on Twitter soon, he would have to visit a doctor for his aching cock."
1308,"WASHINGTON—Experiencing a rising sense of dread as he opened his eyes Friday morning and noticed the woman asleep beside him, a groggy and confused Vice President Mike Pence reportedly muttered, “Oh God, what happened last night?” upon waking up in the same bed as his wife. “This is Karen’s bed—what have Idone?” said a visibly panicked Pence, his fear increasing as he discovered that he was completely naked except for his underwear and pajama pants, while second lady Karen Pence wore no socks or nightcap, her feet and head completely nude. “We didn’t, did we? I mean, I don’t think we did, but I’m not a hundred percent sure. Oh, no, no, no. C’mon, Mike, what’s gotten into you? How could you be so reckless? What on earth were you thinking having that second glass of milk last night? You idiot! You better just hope you didn’t do anything you’ll regret.” At press time, sources reported the vice president was praying that no one would see him as he quietly snuck out of his wife’s bedroom and stumbled back to his own quarters, where he immediately showered in a futile attempt to wash away his shame."
1309,"WASHINGTON—Thinking back to a far simpler time, veteran congressman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) told reporters Thursday that he could still remember when his inaction on gun violence actually presented a moral dilemma. “I can still recall how, years ago, deciding not to take any steps to address universal background checks or a broken mental healthcare system following a mass shooting felt like a real, concrete struggle,” said Grassley, a member of Congress since 1975, reminiscing on how he used to do a lot of mental gymnastics to justify his idleness on the epidemic and would frequently lie awake at night contemplating whether there was blood on his hands. “I have a lot of memories of going back and forth on whether accepting all this money from the NRA made me complicit in all of these deaths. I would sometimes get so troubled by it, I’d even ask my wife or my friends if they thought I was a good person, but nowadays, I just fire off my ‘thoughts and prayers’ tweet without thinking about it and just keep going about my day.” At press time, Grassley admitted that he was starting to get a bit bored after continuing to talk about the subject for so long."
1310,"WASHINGTON—Amid criticism of how long he waited to terminate the employment of Rob Porter, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly apologized Wednesday for assuming everyone would just ignore the abuse allegations against the staff secretary the way they always do in the military. “I am deeply sorry for thinking you would all react the way I’m accustomed to and simply disregard all misconduct claims made against someone in such a powerful position,” said the retired four-star Marine Corps general, explaining that his four decades as an officer in the armed services had led him to expect people would not only turn a blind eye to Porter’s misdeeds, but also denounce his victims as liars and then punish them for questioning authority. “I’m still getting used to a leadership style where the standard approach isn’t to roundly dismiss everything the accusers say, make them apologize to their abusers, and then force them to endure excessively painful drills coupled with dehumanizing insults. But I understand now that as White House chief of staff, you can’t just look the other way every time you’re confronted with violent physical abuse against women.” Kelly went on to promise that in future cases he will act without delay, addressing abuse allegations the very moment they are leaked to the public."
1311,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to make the frequent festivities for departing staffers more efficient, White House officials announced Tuesday that the administration is now just holding one continuous going-away party. “Instead of throwing a send-off celebration for Rob Porter and Rick Dearborn only to turn around and do it again a week later, we will now simply hold around-the-clock gatherings with light refreshments and cupcakes to honor whoever left the administration most recently,” said Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee-Sanders, adding that employees may now join their coworkers at any time of day in the permanently decorated White House kitchen where a never-ending stream of staffers will announce that this is their last day, perpetually deliver farewell speeches, and constantly pass around and sign goodbye cards for continuously departing coworkers. “In order to avoid another situation like when we had three separate get-togethers in one week for Sean Spicer, Michael Short, and Reince Priebus, aides may now enjoy a cup of soda, don a party hat, reminisce over fond memories together, and say their farewells whenever it is convenient for them.” Huckabee-Sanders added that she looks forward to seeing everyone in the kitchen, where she expects to be honored shortly."
1312,"WASHINGTON—As they examined the recently released White House budget, U.S. senators and representatives expressed confusion Tuesday about the $500 million that President Trump has proposed the government spend on “laser stuff” in fiscal year 2019. “While I agree with many of the president’s recommendations, like his proposed cuts to entitlement programs, I have to admit I’m somewhat baffled by the lines in this budget dedicated to ‘state-of-the-art zap-beams,’ ‘powerful ray shooters,’ and ‘high-tech glowing red dots,’” said Sen. Todd Young (R-IN), voicing concerns shared by members of Congress in both parties who sought further clarification about Trump’s plan to subsidize the development of “blue, green, blue-violet, neon yellow, and other lightning-fast colors of laser beams.” “I’ve long advocated for increased military spending, but as a Marine Corps veteran myself, I’m not convinced ‘extra-large laser cannons’ and ‘bright lights that blast you so hard it really hurts’ are what our armed services really need from us right now.” At press time, both houses of Congress reportedly agreed to the allocations after White House aides explained that any funds appropriated for “laser stuff” would be handed over in a lump sum to the nation’s defense contractors."
1313,"WASHINGTON—Championing the decision as a way to cut costs and still meet federally mandated nutrition requirements, President Trump announced a plan Tuesday to replace food stamps with a new low-income foraging program. “We have developed a new foraging-based plan that provides qualifying Americans with a small, reusable bag they can fill with whatever they are able to scavenge from alleys, empty lots, or nearby wooded areas,” said Trump, explaining that underprivileged participants in the program would search for food scraps anywhere they can find them, including the dumpsters behind restaurants. “We will also be providing these low-income Americans with charts that explain which rotting foods are still safe to eat, which seeds and berries can be consumed without getting sick, and how to spot insects that are high in protein. Many disadvantaged citizens don’t have access to healthy meals at home, but this program will teach them the self-reliance they need to ensure their basic requirements for sustenance continue to be met.” Trump also proposed a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in which Americans would receive a weekly meal service kit containing pictures of food."
1314,"WASHINGTON—Heartbroken over the resignation of boyfriend Rob Porter from the Trump administration following reports that the now-former White House staff secretary had physically and emotionally abused his ex-wives, White House Communications Director Hope Hicks told reporters Friday she wished only to find one nice guy in the executive branch’s autocratic personality cult. “Every time I think I’ve found someone who shares my values in this legion of totalitarian sociopaths, they turn out to be nowhere near as good a guy as I first thought,” said Hicks, noting that the dating pool of single, oppressive pricks is fairly small, and connecting with a draconian tyrant who is also sweet and caring is increasingly difficult. “I just know the perfect, ruthless monster for me is out there somewhere in this fanatical hive mind of unfeeling narcissists—a selfish, vicious bastard who will sweep me off my feet. I just have to find the one for me.” As of press time, White House sources reported Hicks had been seen making eyes at a male colleague rumored to have good looks, kind eyes, and the appealing personality of a serial killer."
1315,"ARLINGTON, VA—The Department of Homeland Security released a report Thursday confirming that Russia had in fact penetrated U.S. voter databases in order to ensure the 2016 general election was fair and free, just like the loyal allies they are. “After an exhaustive, months-long investigation, we have discovered hundreds of thousands of instances in which Russian agents accessed voter information, thereby safeguarding and upholding our most deeply held democratic values,” said director of the National Protection and Programs Directorate Jeanette Manfra, noting that Russia’s unwavering support for the integrity of American democracy has been shown time and time again throughout history and now even reaches the executive branch of our government. “On November 8, 2016, Russian operatives are believed to have executed a highly sophisticated effort to preserve and uphold the right of every American to vote, thus ensuring the safe and just execution of our Founding Fathers’ noble vision. All U.S. citizens—and, indeed, all those who believe in democracy—should thank these steadfast hacker groups for their coordinated efforts in developing those state-sponsored automated programs that gained access to the personal and private data of innumerable U.S. voters.” Manfra went on to say that our stalwart and generous Russian allies will also meddle with voter data later this year to ensure that the vital midterm elections are also fair and free."
1316,"WASHINGTON—Explaining the rationale behind a two-year government budget deal crafted by members of both parties hours ahead of a potential shutdown, congressional leaders told reporters Thursday that they had put aside their partisan differences for the good of the nation’s military contractors. “It’s time that we stop bickering with each other over minor political disputes and start standing up for the brave defense contractors who keep us safe,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), echoing the sentiments of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and other congressional leaders as they championed the bipartisan spending increases that would provide billions of much-needed government subsidies to U.S. military companies. “We may not always see eye to eye, but both Democrats and Republicans recognize how important it is to put politics aside when we’re talking about the men and women in our private military sector.” Senate leaders also expressed their satisfaction that the two parties could set aside their partisan disagreements to ensure that the bill did absolutely nothing to push for immigration reform."
1317,"WASHINGTON—Wearing a leotard and chain-smoking as he pounded out the measures with his cane, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly screamed, “It’s step, twist, step, dammit!” at a group of Marines on Wednesday as they learned the choreography for President Trump’s upcoming military parade. “Jesus Christ, how many times do I have to tell you it’s step, twist, step, shuffle, lean-and-point, and point-and-roll?” a visibly furious Kelly said as he threw a chair across the military hangar, removed his scarf, and commanded the battalion to “just watch [him]” as he demonstrated the dance in front of a full-length mirror. “Again, do it again! We’ll stay here all night if we have to. Seriously, you call yourselves dancers? It’s like I’m working with a bunch of goddamn amateurs.” After exploding at a private first class whom he sent home for wearing the wrong boots, Kelly told everyone they were taking a “quick five,” and that when they returned, they had better do it right or he would be making some cuts."
1318,"WASHINGTON—Hastily scrawling with crayons and markers, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump were reportedly forging their father’s signature Wednesday on letters they had written excusing them from any further testifying as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into their family’s role in potential Russian election interference. “To ALL it may conzern, my two beutiful Sons are herebye Excused from anymore testifonials to mean mister Muler,” the two wrote on dozens of pieces of construction paper before Donald Jr. falsified his father’s signature, following a heated hour-long argument over who did a better imitation of the president’s handwriting. “My son’s Eric Jr and Dom haev a realy bad sick thing in their throats Forever now so they cant talk to mr. Muller ever again and he should leave Them alone okay? Sincerly the Presdient of United states.” At press time, the Trump boys were enclosing the letters in envelopes addressed to a variety of government agencies, police departments, and fire stations around the country as well as affixing stickers of gold stars or American flags to ensure each envelope looked official."
1319,"WASHINGTON—Tiptoeing across the floor of his bathroom in stockinged feet to quiet his approach, California Representative Devin Nunes reportedly shouted, “Aha!” Thursday before pulling back a shower curtain in the hopes of revealing a hidden FBI agent. “You thought you could hide from me,” the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee screamed into the empty bathtub before cursing softly, diving to the floor, and rolling down the hallway to the kitchen where he proceeded to yank open cabinet doors, the refrigerator, and the oven’s broiler drawer while attempting to find a FBI agent concealed inside. “The jig is up! I’ve got you bastards now!”At press time, a bleary-eyed Nunes was frantically tearing all the stuffing out of his couch cushions in an unsuccessful attempt to locate an FBI surveillance van."
1320,"WASHINGTON—In a high-priority email sent to the entire staff, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt ordered all employees Friday to stay in the office over the weekend while it’s being fumigated. “This communication is to inform you that workers will be spraying down the office with fumigants this weekend, so everyone should please be here Saturday between the hours of 9 a.m. and 7 p.m.,” Pruitt wrote, noting that because the room will be filled with noxious pesticides, EPA employees would be expected to remain at their desks for the duration of the procedure. “In the interest of being thorough, agency procedure requires you remain in the building the entire day that toxic fumes are being released in the building and the windows be closed at all times.” Pruitt also attached a postscript reminding staffers to be in the office two weekends from now for a scheduled asbestos installation."
1321,"GUANTANAMO BAY, CUBA—Applauding and cheering as news spread that their beloved, longtime home had been saved by executive order, the inmates of Guantánamo Bay celebrated Thursday in a spontaneous outpouring of both joy and relief. “President Trump really came through for us, my brothers—he saved the one place we’ve ever truly been able to call our own!” said 16-year prisoner and former Afghani herdsman Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, one of the dozens of men at Guantánamo who have been imprisoned without warrant, interrogated without restraint, and due to recent opposition, faced the possibility of having to leave the war prison where they have spent so many of their formative years as detainees. “I was worried the ACLU or Amnesty International or even the previous administration would close this unique place where I’ve spent nearly half my life and made some great friends, but now I get to stay right here. Thank you, President Trump—it’s people like you that reaffirm everything I believe.” At press time, the residents of Guantánamo Bay were holding an impromptu “block party” during their weekly 15 minutes of outdoor time."
1322,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that such an action would be highly reckless, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned Thursday that releasing the “Nunes Memo” could potentially undermine faith in the massive, unaccountable government secret agencies of the United States. “Making this memo public will almost certainly impede our ability to conduct clandestine activities operating outside any legal or judicial system on an international scale,” said Wray, noting that it was essential that mutual trust exist between the American people and the vast, mysterious cabal given free rein to use any tactics necessary to conduct surveillance on U.S. citizens or subvert religious and political groups. “If we take away the people’s faith in this shadowy monolith exempt from any consequences, all that’s left is an extensive network of rogue, unelected intelligence officers carrying out extrajudicial missions for a variety of subjective, and occasionally personal, reasons.” At press time, Wray confirmed the massive, unaccountable government secret agencies were unaware of any wrongdoing for violating constitutional rights."
1323,"WASHINGTON—Ending any speculation over whether he would submit to questioning on the subject, lawyers representing President Trump confirmed Wednesday he is willing to clear up any concerns that talk show host Sean Hannity may have about his 2016 campaign’s alleged collusion with Russia. “The president has expressed to us that he is fully committed to cooperating with Mr. Hannity on all aspects of the Russia issue,” said White House attorney Ty Cobb, adding that his client looks forward to speaking with the Fox News anchor on the record and, furthermore, is not the least bit worried about the revelations that will result from Hannity’s line of inquiry. “Whether the questions are about why Mr. Trump, as a candidate, had no reason to collude, or how Hillary Clinton has done much worse, the president is ready to provide complete and detailed responses. He understands the level of accountability to which he will be held by a person in Mr. Hannity’s position, and he is entirely prepared for it.” Cobb went on to express confidence that Hannity will ultimately conclude the president has engaged in no wrongdoing."
1324,"WASHINGTON—Declaring during his first State of the Union address that the United States “must restore the rule of law,” President Trump took a hard line on domestic security issues Tuesday night as members of his staff handed out loaded revolvers to everyone in attendance. “Our way of life is being threatened by violent criminals and all these people pouring into our country and doing these terrible things,” the president said as staffers carried in wicker baskets full of Colt .45s, .357 Magnums, and Ruger GP100s and distributed them to the 115th Congress, the Supreme Court, the Cabinet, and various guests, all of whom began inspecting and, in some cases cocking, the weapons. “It’s long past time we did our jobs and liberated ourselves from the thugs overrunning our cities and towns. Let’s throw these animals out of America once and for all—starting right now.” Though Trump’s words were met with thunderous applause and celebratory small-arms fire, sources confirmed plans to begin administering justice immediately were delayed after it was discovered Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had accidentally shot his entire face off."
1325,"WASHINGTON—Swearing this was the last time he would trust a seller on the street, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin was forced to watch the State of the Union address from home Tuesday after getting ripped off by a ticket scalper. “I should have known something was up when that sketchy asshole claimed he had awesome seats one row back from the president,” said Durbin, who curled up on his couch and picked at a bowl of microwave popcorn while watching U.S. legislators file into the House Chamber on his television. “Ugh, those goddamn tickets were clearly printed out at home. There wasn’t even a hologram on them. I never should have believed that sneaky bastard, but I had already bragged to my guests about the great seats I was going to get. What a waste of 800 bucks.”At press time, Durbin was reportedly offering soda and chips to the Dreamer family that he had invited to accompany him to the State of the Union address."
1326,"WASHINGTON—Saying the outing was a well-deserved treat for laboring on President Trump’s upcoming State of the Union address, senior policy advisor Stephen Miller reportedly rewarded himself Tuesday with a trip to see all the children at a local ICE detention center. “I’ve been putting in some pretty long hours, so it’s nice to unwind a little at the Immigration and Customs facility watching all the kids held indefinitely in federal custody,” said Miller, who stopped outside a cramped 6-by-8 cell to smile warmly at a set of scared, parentless 7- and 8-year-old Mexican siblings, adding that the tear-streaked faces filled his heart with joy. “It’s so gratifying see those trembling little chins and reddened eyes filled with palpable fear. I love listening to those tiny whimpers and sobs. So cute. God, this place is amazing. I really haven’t had this much fun in a long time.” At press time, a reflective Miller was fondly recalling that unnecessarily detained, mistreated immigrants were the reason he got into politics in the first place."
1327,"EAST LANSING, MI—Reflecting the American electorate’s increasing openness to unconventional political candidates, a new poll released by Michigan State University on Monday found that 78 percent of Americans would vote for the Liberty Bell in a presidential election. “A large majority of those surveyed said they could see themselves casting a vote for the iconic bell, citing their admiration for its strong outsider perspective and independence from established political parties,” said head pollster Kevin Han, adding that many respondents were impressed with the work it had done locally in Philadelphia and view the 2,080-pound bell as truly embodying the classic American values they hold dear. “About 68 percent thought it could restore dignity to the office, 42 percent thought it would represent the country well overseas, and 57 percent said they could see themselves getting a beer with it. Admiration for the widespread celebrity it’s attained by appearing on commemorative stamps and monetary notes also played a major role in determining support.” Han went on to say that most of the 22 percent who didn’t support the bell cited the large crack on its face as a deal-breaker."
1328,"DAVOS—Maintaining that the notion didn’t even cross his mind, President Trump reportedly insisted Friday that he never once thought about firing Robert Mueller, feeding him to a pack of rabid dogs, and mounting his head in the Oval Office as a trophy. “At no point did I ever consider firing Mr. Mueller, tossing his body to snarling, mangy hounds, and having his head stuffed and mounted front and center above the Oval Office fireplace,” said Trump, dismissing several reports that he had ordered the special counsel to be terminated from his post and torn limb from limb by starving Rottweilers before nailing his skull to a wooden plaque, but backed off when a top White House lawyer threatened to quit. “It’s also totally ridiculous to think that I would ever want Mueller gone for good, boiled alive, and chopped up into bloody chunks. The stories you’re hearing about me trying to get rid of Mueller and then gutting him with a rusty ice pick are absolutely not true.” At press time, Trump asserted that if he ever did one day decide to forcibly castrate Mueller and set him on fire, it would be fully within his authority as president."
1329,"WASHINGTON—Leaping out from behind a wall as Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock and Roll” blared from the building’s intercom, a pantless Secretary of State Rex Tillerson slid across the waxed marble floors of the completely empty State Department, sources confirmed Wednesday. The nation’s top diplomat, clad in only a dress shirt, white tube socks, and a loose-fitting pair of briefs, was reportedly seen performing a variety of spirited dance moves throughout the labyrinth of abandoned offices and conference rooms, singing along into a rolled up foreign policy paper that also doubled as a makeshift saxophone. “Okay Rexie, so you’ve flung pencils into the drop ceiling of the Counterterrorism Bureau, made a lasso with the flags in the Hall of Allies, and karate-chopped through all those dumb old paintings in the lobby—what’s on tap next?” Tillerson said, pausing to eat from a stray bucket of KFC before pitching a bundle of newly issued passports into the trash bin. “From downtown….it’s good! And the crowd goes wild!” “Wooo!” he continued. Sources confirmed that after realizing he was the sole occupant of the Harry S. Truman building at approximately 1:30 p.m., Tillerson first began entertaining himself by dancing on a computer terminal in the vacant Office of Emergencies in the Diplomatic and Consular Service, later tying a necktie around his head and commando-crawling through a maze of tunnels he built using furniture from the John Quincy Adams State Drawing Room. The 65-year-old then reportedly arranged stacks of correspondence from the Office of the Undersecretary for Arms Control and International Security, which he positioned as bowling pins and attempted to knock down with a rolling swivel chair. Sources confirmed the Secretary also soiled and ruined several Persian rugs by crouching in a half-full mop bucket and spraying a fire extinguisher as a rudimentary form of propulsion. “Hi, Domino’s? This is Scott Pruitt speaking. I want to order 200 pizzas to the Environmental Protection Agency office—with extra anchovies—and step on it!” said a giggling Tillerson, speaking in a high-pitched falsetto voice while wrapping the phone cord around his head. “Oh, and if those pizzas aren’t in my office in 30 minutes, the government is going to sue you for all you’ve got.” “Also, climate change is real!” he added, slamming down the phone and filling his mouth with whipped cream from two canisters simultaneously. According to sources, Tillerson spent much of the afternoon shredding official documents, including the justification for the use of military force in Syria and the formal resignation from the Paris Climate Accord, whose remains he tossed into the air like confetti. Sources reported that he also commandeered a framed map from the Diplomatic Reception Room to sled down the vacant stairwells before pressing all the elevator buttons and racing it back to the building’s top floor. In addition, sources said that at one point, while duck-walking through the Edward Vason Jones Memorial Hall, the former ExxonMobil CEO tripped and crashed into a marble bust of George Washington—on which he had previously drawn a handlebar mustache—knocking it to the floor and shattering it. He then reportedly grabbed the pieces and brought them to a nearby window, alternately yelling “tally-ho!” and “I’m bored” as he heaved each of them onto the sidewalk. At press time, Tillerson was mooning a busload of Taiwanese tourists when U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley walked in."
1330,"WASHINGTON—Following the passage of a temporary government funding bill approved by many Democrats that did not include protections for immigrants brought illegally to U.S. as children, Senators Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, and Elizabeth Warren reportedly assured Dreamers Tuesday that they will never stop fighting for the 2020 presidential nomination. “To all Dreamers who are concerned about their future in this country, I promise that I will do absolutely everything in my power to secure the Democratic Party nomination two years from now,” said Booker, echoing the sentiments of Harris and Warren, as well as fellow Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Bernie Sanders, in his pledge to take a stand and keep battling on behalf of his presidential aspirations until the 2020 Democratic National Convention. “I want all Dreamers to know that while times are tough right now, and it may be difficult to envision the day when I’ve secured enough primary votes to become the nominee, they should not give up hope. I voted against this stopgap funding bill, just as I will vote against any bill that would do anything to decrease my chances of becoming the 46th president of the United States.” At press time, Booker, Harris, and Warren were leading a rally on the Capitol steps calling for a legislative solution that once and for all would resolve their status as frontrunners for their party’s nomination."
1331,"WASHINGTON—After yesterday’s announcement that the president received a perfect score on his cognitive assessment, White House physician Ronny L. Jackson told reporters Wednesday that follow-up tests confirmed that President Trump’s 19 other personalities are also perfectly healthy. “After an extensive psychological evaluation, we’ve determined that Tommy JoJo, Professor O’Shannassy, Officer Pittz, and each of the president’s 16 other identities are in good condition,” said Jackson, adding that each distinct psychic identity, from Little Holly Anne Tibblseby to DJ Pump ’Em Up, demonstrated robust mental acuity, emotional stability, and memory function. “Despite the advanced age of Ol’ Jack the 70-year-old New York cabby and Civil War colonel Virgil Conway, none of President Trump’s personalities exhibited signs of neurological deterioration. Even 3-year-old Jacky demonstrated the clarity and intellectual fitness required to handle the presidency.” At press time, however, Jackson reported the emergence of a volatile Fred Trump personality, which was in a constant state of agitation and which left the president exhausted long after it returned control of his mind."
1332,"WASHINGTON—Chastising the assembled reporters for failing to cover the story, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders repeatedly insisted Wednesday that President Trump’s footprints created the Great Lakes. “In its relentless effort to undermine this administration, the media has completely ignored the fact that Lake Huron and Lake Ontario were formed when the gigantic, thundering footfalls of the president made impressions in the ground during a stroll along the U.S.-Canada border,” said Huckabee Sanders, adding that media outlets had willfully chosen not to acknowledge that the enormousness of Lake Superior was due to the president jumping up as high as the moon and landing on the earth with all his might. “Frankly, it’s disgusting that journalists are obsessed with the president’s health when they should know full well that when he was five years old, he was already so big that he had to use a wagon wheel as a coat button and so strong that he could clear a whole pond of bullfrogs with one holler.” At press time, however, Huckabee Sanders had amended her remarks, noting that Fox News had indeed reported that the president’s frustration with Democrats had led him to shed the massive teardrops that formed the Mississippi River."
1333,"NEW YORK—Alleging she was deeply concerned about the destructive effect the revelation could have on her reputation, a new report released Tuesday suggests that adult film star Stormy Daniels may have paid over $130,000 to cover up a sexual encounter with Donald Trump. “Newly uncovered legal documents seem to indicate that Ms. Daniels paid out six figures to keep Trump quiet about a sexual encounter that undoubtedly would have proved embarrassing and perhaps career-threatening,” said report coauthor Wendy Thorpe, adding that the star of films such asTit HappensandLove Potion 69was so desperate to keep the liaison under wraps that she insisted on using pseudonyms in the settlement to protect her identity if it was ever discovered. “In addition to Ms. Daniels, we have identified at least four other women who each paid out more than $100,000 in order to bury humiliating stories about their potentially ruinous trysts with Trump. Understandably, each of the women was deeply concerned that he would go public and completely destroy their careers.” At press time, Daniel’s lawyers had issued a statement condemning the report and claiming that any insinuation of a sexual relationship between Donald Trump and their client was nothing more than a “shameful and outrageous” attempt to defame her."
1334,"WASHINGTON—Saying the current disapproval would soon give way to support, House Speaker Paul Ryan was confident Thursday that the American people will warm up to the new tax plan once they realize life is a cruel and meaningless farce. “Although it may not be very popular now, I’m certain that Americans will come around to this new system when they begin to understand the ruthless absurdity of existence,” said Ryan, explaining that once taxpayers see that there is no objective moral framework in the unforgiving chaos of the universe, they will learn to appreciate what this bill actually does. “I think many voters will find a lot in this tax overhaul that they can embrace when it finally dawns on them that they have no agency and it’s futile to resist entropy. We just need to keep hammering home to average folks that our time here on Earth is a joke with no punchline.” At press time, Ryan said that once Americans accepted the brutality and pointlessness of life, they’d be just as amenable to gutting Medicare."
1335,"WASHINGTON—Grinning proudly as blood gushed from his victim’s windpipe, House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly slit an auto mechanic’s throat Wednesday to kick off the GOP purge of the working class. “With our tax reform bill giving us the mandate we have long desired, there’s nothing stopping us now—commence the bloodletting!” said Ryan, holding up the lifeless body of the local blue-collar worker as blood from his severed arteries sprayed reporters gathered at the press conference. “Now we can finally experience the sweet release of all our pent-up hatred of the parasitic working class without fear of punishment or retribution. The blood of the filthy proletariat will flow in the streets, and the families of truck drivers, nurses, and retail employees all over the nation will know our wrath. No one making under $50,000 a year is safe. Today, the American economy will be put back on the right track, and the liquidation begins!” At press time, blood-drenched Republican senators Bob Corker and Lisa Murkowski were seen sprinting into a Baltimore Walmart wielding machetes."
1336,"WASHINGTON—In the wake of the $1.5 trillion tax bill’s historic passage in both the House and the Senate, GOP leaders reportedly celebrated Wednesday their decisive win over everyday American citizens. “This is a monumental victory not only for us, but for everyone struggling under the reign of the average American,” said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, adding that party leaders made a promise to “take a stand against ordinary U.S. citizens,” before cracking open a bottle of champagne and proudly declaring that “today, we delivered.” “Of course, the fight against the people of this country is not yet over. We won this battle, but the war is still to come. However, if we carry on with the same vigor demonstrated today in our widely opposed tax overhaul, I know that we will prevail over Americans time and time again.” GOP leaders also expressed confidence that they would achieve another dominant victory over the American people as they push to close the deficit by cutting food stamp programs, Social Security, and Medicare."
1337,"WASHINGTON—Saying that each of them would always have a place in his heart, special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly ascended into the sky with an umbrella Monday after the Trump family promised they had learned their lesson about honesty. “And now, my dear friends, it is time for me to leave you,” said Mueller, opening the large umbrella he had pulled from his magical brief bag and slowly rising into the air as the Trump family tearfully waved goodbye and assured the special prosecutor that the valuable wisdom he had bestowed upon them through song and enchanted adventures would never be forgotten. “I must go and teach other little boys and girls about the importance of always telling the truth. Remember, Trump family: Honesty is the best policy.” At press time, the Trump family was reportedly making sure to cover up any evidence of having any knowledge or understanding about morals and consequences."
1338,"WASHINGTON—Instructing him to hold still while he connected the various wires, sources confirmed Thursday that Eric Trump hooked his older brother Donald Jr. up to an Xbox, iPad, and Roomba in order to practice passing a polygraph test. “We gotta do this a bunch of times because the machine can use your heartbeats to read your mind and tell if you’re lying or not,” said Eric, who taped USB and headphone cables to his brother’s chest and then directed him to rest one of his hands on the Roomba so it could detect any trembling caused by anxiety about not telling the truth. “Okay, I’ll monitor your brain on the iPad. If you have to fib, picture something nice while doing it because that will confuse the lie detector. Okay, first question: Are you a Russian spy?” At press time, Eric declared the results inconclusive after grabbing the Xbox controller and deciding to play Injustice 2 instead."
1339,"WASHINGTON—Citing robust support for its measures including a sharp reduction or outright repeal of the estate tax, a new report published Thursday revealed that the Republican tax overhaul is supported by a majority of Americans currently suffocating their wealthy benefactor with a pillow. “Both the House and Senate tax plans enjoy a healthy 87 percent approval rating among citizens whose hands are tightly gripping a pillowcase and firmly pressing it down over the face of a bedridden family member or patron until they stop struggling,” said lead author Alice Zarzycki, noting that nearly nine in 10 Americans whispering “shh, shh, sleep now” as their thrashing benefactor landed increasingly feeble blows to their arms and chest indicated that the proposed legislation would considerably improve their personal financial situation. “This level of support even outpaces that of other groups who have endorsed the tax plans, including Americans lying under a Rolls Royce clipping its brake lines or currently pushing their elderly charge’s wheelchair toward the edge of a tall spiral staircase.” Zarzycki went on to say that the 13 percent disapproval rate came primarily from Americans who had smothered their benefactor without first altering the will to name themselves as the sole heir."
1340,"BIRMINGHAM, AL—In an effort to recognize the group’s pivotal role in helping elect Democrat Doug Jones to the Senate, the DNC took out a full-page ad Wednesday inThe Birmingham Newsthanking Alabama’s working-class white voters. “To each and every white, working-class Alabaman who made their voices heard yesterday: We thank you,” read the advertisement in part, adding that Democrats were able to achieve the unimaginable in one of the most conservative states in the nation because “White Alabama believed in doing what’s right and turned out to vote like never before.” “You in the white working-class are the reason the Democratic Party took another step toward reclaiming government for all Americans. Caucasians, we will not forget you.” The ad went on to salute white working-class males as the most unsung heroes of all."
1341,"HUNTSVILLE, AL—Scanning his mind for any minority groups he could have demonized more forcefully, Alabama Senate candidate and secret Democratic operative Roy Moore admitted Tuesday that he wasn’t sure what else he could have done to destroy the Republican Party’s reputation. “When Nancy [Pelosi] sent me here, I was convinced that revealing myself as a pedophile would be more than enough, but now I’m just at a loss,” said Moore, who admitted he thought DNC chair Tom Perez was going over the top by suggesting he say gay marriage had made the U.S. the source of all evil, but that didn’t even budge the polls. “I mean, I stood on a stage and wistfully recalled the era in which slavery existed in this country. What else am I supposed to do? I’ve been really digging deep to vilify the GOP and make myself unelectable, but I still might win.” At press time, Moore was kicking himself for not sabotaging himself more egregiously by claiming he supported a ban on assault weapons."
1342,"WASHINGTON—In response to the 15 individuals who have come forward alleging sexual misconduct by the president, Donald Trump reportedly dismissed his accusers Tuesday as women. “Anyone can see that these disgraceful and false allegations are clearly coming from total, utter women,” said Trump, adding that those claiming he groped, fondled, and forcibly kissed them “absolutely know that they’re female” and that “everyone else knows they are, too.” “These are obvious women we’re dealing with, okay? Each and every one of them. It’s a shame that anyone can be such an undeniable woman and just get away with it.” Trump went on to say that many of the people supporting his accusers had no credibility either because they’re just as much women as the accusers themselves."
1343,"HEMPSTEAD, NY—Bursting through the glowing space-time portal backstage just before the first debate of the 2016 presidential election, a frantic time-traveling Hillary Clinton reportedly warned her past self to do everything in the exact same way. “Listen very carefully because we don’t have much time: Make sure you do everything that you’re already intending to do,” said the future Clinton, passionately urging her year-younger self to execute her current campaign strategy precisely as planned. “Now this election is going to have a lot of unpredictable moments, but, no matter what, you must change absolutely nothing—remember, no matter what the end result, you did everything right.” At press time, present-day Hillary Clinton was being counseled by 2020 Hillary Clinton on the grave importance of not doing anything differently if she wanted to lose again three years from now."
1344,"NEW YORK—Growing increasingly worried as news reports indicated that he communicated with the whistleblower organization during his father’s presidential campaign, a panicked Donald Trump Jr. reportedly tried to cover up his contact with WikiLeaks Friday by frantically deleting the Mozilla Firefox icon from his desktop. “Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, I gotta make sure they never, ever track me down,” said Trump, who dragged and dropped the Firefox icon on his home screen to the computer’s recycling bin and then proceeded to turn off his Wi-Fi, close the laptop without powering down, insert the device into a gel sleeve, and hide it under his bed for “maximum protection.” “I hafta be super careful. These feds are breathing down my neck, so I’m gonna go off the grid for a little bit.” At press time, Trump, who deemed the situation an “unexpected emergency,” retrieved the laptop, restored the icon, and used the browser to order food delivery before deleting it again and carefully concealing the computer under a blanket."
1345,"WASHINGTON—As part of their effort to rein in government spending through entitlement reform, GOP congressional leaders announced Friday that their new tax plan will require welfare recipients to apply for each individual piece of food they receive. “Mandating that all Americans on food stamps submit a separate application for every morsel they want to buy ensures that they get the nutrition they need without wasting taxpayer dollars,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, explaining that the new bill would significantly reduce the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program by requiring low-income Americans to make a case for each piece of fruit, slice of bread, or grain of rice they plan to purchase. “Putting more onus on welfare recipients to justify why they need to buy something like a potato chip, a dollop of mayonnaise, or a pinch of salt with taxpayer money will help increase personal responsibility and reduce waste. In addition, parents will be required to fill out separate forms itemizing each mouthful taken by their children, which will enable them to be adequately nourished while not indulging in superfluous calories at government expense.” Ryan added that the bill also included work-requirement reform mandating that all food stamp recipients submit daily paperwork to their SNAP office with a valid explanation for each minute they weren’t working."
1346,"WASHINGTON—Saying he could no longer joke effectively in the Senate, Congressman Al Franken announced Thursday that he was resigning from office, telling colleagues, “I’m deeply sorry for my hilarious actions.” “The things I did, while extremely funny, were also inappropriate and I sincerely apologize for the pain I’ve caused with my gut-busting antics,” said a chuckling Franken, describing the perfectly-timed physical comedy routines he regularly performed on unsuspecting women, such as honking their breasts and planting sloppy kisses on their cheeks as they recoiled. “I can see that my wacky hijinks have offended my colleagues who have no sense of humor, which is why I must step down as senator of Minnesota. To everyone I’ve hurt, I ask that one day you can forgive me for being such a big goofball.” At press time, Franken was struggling to contain his laughter after goosing a journalist who had asked him a follow-up question."
1347,"WASHINGTON—Vowing that the ancestral shantytowns would endure, President Trump promised Wednesday that the United States would continue to recognize and preserve Palestinians’ historic refugee camps. “Today I pledge to Palestine our ongoing acknowledgement and commitment to maintaining the makeshift shelters their people have been living in for generations,” said Trump, promising to fight for the overcrowded communities of displaced people to always have tattered canvas tents without basic human necessities. “Though we still hope to broker lasting peace with the Israelis, we must also affirm the Palestinians’ sovereign right to remain in the crude dwellings of their forced relocation. There must be no ambiguity. These dilapidated shacks devoid of electricity or adequate plumbing are the Palestinian homeland.” At press time, Trump formally moved the center of U.S. diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority to the Baqa’a refugee camp in Jordan."
1348,"WASHINGTON—Amid intense nationwide scrutiny of the polarizing blaze, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke on Tuesday came out in support of a controversial wildfire in Southern California. “While I recognize that there has been some debate as to its merits, I nevertheless see no reason not to pledge my support to this outstanding and highly capable wildfire,” said Zinke, adding that, despite some recent negative attention from the media, the raging conflagration has dutifully and honorably consumed tens of thousands of acres. “It’s a truly wonderful inferno that I’ve gotten to know very well and that, frankly, doesn’t get enough credit for all the hard work it does.” At press time, Zinke reaffirmed his support for the wildfire despite its contentious decision to force thousands of people to evacuate their homes."
1349,"WASHINGTON—Recognizing that he’s a piece of shit who doesn’t deserve to walk the face of the earth yet was still on the right side of party lines, the Republican National Committee released their new “He’s A Scumbag, But He’s Our Scumbag” ad Tuesday to endorse Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. “He’s a horrendous slimeball and a totally fucking despicable lowlife creep, but above all, he’s a republican, and that’s what matters,” said RNC chair Ronna Romney McDaniel, adding that the slogan, which would be emblazoned across campaign banners, buttons, and commercials, embodied the party’s principles even if its ranks happen to include a disgusting, immoral, garbage person like Roy Moore. “We might not all agree on some of his actions, and we may take offense to his vile beliefs, but in the end, he does vote with the party on the issues we need him to. I think the voters will understand that yes, we are asking them to vote for a racist, sexist, xenophobic alleged pedophile but at the same time, he’s our repulsive cesspool of a human being.” At press time, the RNC was reportedly celebrating Roy Moore’s surge in the polls among Alabama republicans in response to the ad."
1350,"WASHINGTON—Appearing to have become unhinged during recent questioning, White House Senior Advisor Jared Kushner reportedly whispered Tuesday, “I’ll have to obstruct one last thing,” before wrapping his gloved hands around special counsel Robert Mueller’s neck. “You want to talk about my security clearance? This is my security clearance,” said Kushner while he slowly strangled the former FBI director who had been conducting an investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election with possible collusion from the Trump campaign. “You wanna tell me what I left off my SF-86 form now, Mr. Mueller, do you? Maybe you want to talk more Russian sanctions. Isthiscandid enough for you? I got your backchannel right here.” At press time, Kushner had reportedly started sobbing after jamming a finger on Mueller’s throat."
1351,"WASHINGTON—Testifying to a judge that he was prepared to take full responsibility for his egregious actions, former National Security advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty Friday to lying to the FBI, but, worst of all, lying to himself. “I am prepared to admit that I lied to FBI officials about my contact with Russian officials—but, far, far worse than that, I was dishonest with myself,” said Flynn, adding that his false statements to investigators probing possible collusion between the Trump campaign and an adversarial foreign power had been part of the infinitely greater evil of not living true to the man he knows he is. “As much as I should never have lied about undermining American democracy, what’s more important is how I deceived myself into becoming someone I didn’t recognize in the mirror. I must repair the horrible damage I’ve done to this nation and, even more egregiously, to my self-esteem.” Flynn concluded his testimony by saying that, in the end, if he came out of this ordeal a better man, all the damage he caused will have been worth it."
1352,"WASHINGTON—Saying that its presence had been a valuable source of comfort at a difficult time, President Trump reportedly told the White House cockroach infestation on Friday that it alone truly understood him. “Things are so tough right now, and it’s nice to know someone out there has so much in common with me, really gets what I’m feeling,” said Trump to the skittering mass of insects that coated the walls, furniture, and floor of the Oval Office and feasted on a rotting hamburger in a wastepaper basket. “We just have a bond, and it gives me strength to know someone really accepts me as I am. Heck, sometimes I think you might even know me better than I know myself.” At press time, an emotional Trump had scooped up a teeming armful of cockroaches to his chest for a long, tender hug."
1353,"WASHINGTON—Smiling as she found just the right spot for the decoration, Melania Trump hung a decayed badger carcass over the White House mantel Thursday in keeping with the traditions of Slovenian Christmas. “Ah, it finally feels like the holidays,” said the First Lady, adding that the animal’s decomposing remains really complemented the charred Christmas shrub she has set up every year since she was a little girl back in her home country. “The smell of putrefying innards and ash always gets me into the holiday spirit, just like it did in Slovenia. All that’s left is to leave out a bowl of snow broth for Santa Claus and hope he does not smother us in our sleep!” At press time, Melania had gathered her family in the dining room for the time-honored Slovenian Christmas meal of a boiled leather belt divided up and eaten in silence."
1354,"WASHINGTON—After solemnly chanting the Latin funereal hymn “Dies Irae” in unison, hooded members of Congress on Wednesday reportedly drowned another love child in the Potomac River to prevent an affair from getting out. “So that this bastard child is never again blessed with the light of another morning, we now commit him to the depths of this river,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, who held the day-old baby above his head for all 535 cloaked legislators to look upon and then handed the squirming infant to Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who placed it in a burlap sack and gently lowered it into the chilly water. “Tonight, we from both chambers renounce it, we deny it a name, and we offer it to the Potomac to rid this world of what should not have been and cannot be any longer. With this athame blade, I now begin the blood oath.” At press time, a couple in Alexandria, VA discovered the infant downriver and decided to raise it as their own."
1355,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to motivate Americans into giving more generously, a new GOP plan unveiled Tuesday would offer generous tax breaks on all contributions tucked into congressmen’s suit breast pockets. “Under this new proposal, Americans would be afforded the ability to write off any donation that is coolly slipped into the breast pocket of a congressman’s suit,” said Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), explaining that if the plan passed, taxpayers would receive even greater deductions for larger wads slid into elected representative’s front pocket with a wink and a nod. “This should hopefully provide much-needed incentive to Americans to palm off larger denominations while shaking their senators’ or representatives’ hands.” McConnell went on to say that supplemental tax credits would also be provided on each luxury car belonging to the keys that just happen to appear on a congressman’s desk."
1356,"WASHINGTON—Amid mounting sexual misconduct allegations against the Minnesota senator, Al Franken tearfully announced to reporters Tuesday his intention to step down from his role as a harasser of women. “I’ve discussed it with my family and, sadly, I’ve come to the conclusion that the best course of action is for me to resign as a groper of women,” said Franken, adding that as much as he’d like to continue making unwanted sexual advances, he will vacate the position effective immediately. “While I wish it didn’t have to come to this, I now believe removing myself from my post as a serial harasser who uses his power to act inappropriately towards the women around him is what’s best for all parties.” Franken went on to say that, despite this decision, he is grateful for every minute he had in the role."
1357,"WASHINGTON—Feeling devastated by the thought that he could no longer provide assistance to millions of disadvantaged Americans, a tearful President Trump reportedly put down his ladle Tuesday and walked out of a soup kitchen after learning that the Donald J. Trump Foundation was shutting down. “There was so much I could have done to help those in need, but now it’s just not going to happen,” said a visibly distressed Trump who, upon being informed of the philanthropic organization’s closure, solemnly dumped a kettle filled with hot stew into the garbage several minutes before the start of the meal service. “I think of all the sick, the poor, and the disabled who will suffer because of the federal laws my charitable organization violated and, Jesus, it just breaks my heart. Those beautiful, wonderful souls—God, I can’t bear it.” At press time, Trump took one last heartbreaking look at the line of homeless men, women, and children as he exited the building before collapsing to his knees and crying."
1358,"WASHINGTON—Saying the court expected to finish the year strong even without their most productive swing voter, sources reported Monday that Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy will be out for the rest of the Supreme Court session after tearing his adjudicatory tendon. “Unfortunately, these kinds of injuries take a lot of time to fully heal, so he’ll be sidelined for the year’s remaining cases while he recovers,” said Supreme Court spokesman Stephen Howell, adding that the 81-year-old judge had already torn his adjudicatory tendon once before while writing the majority opinion for Bragdon v. Abbott in 1998. “Justice Kennedy underwent arthroscopic surgery yesterday, and doctors believe he’ll be back in time to hear arguments on the Janus v. American Federation union fees case in January. However, these injuries can be unpredictable, so we’ll constantly be monitoring his ability to deliberate along the way.” Howell went on to say that, prior to officially returning to his seat, Kennedy may spend several weeks rehabbing his injury on the U.S. Court of Appeals."
1359,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concerns about a potentially disastrous scandal, President Trump reportedly confided to White House officials Friday that he was terrified that his sexual assault victims would someday come forward. “I’m seeing all this news lately about women speaking out against these men who acted very inappropriately toward them and the repercussions those same men now face, and I’m honestly scared of what would happen if one day I’m accused publicly by 10 or maybe even more women whom I’ve harassed or assaulted in the past,” said a visibly shaken Trump, adding that the president of the United States was held to a higher standard of conduct and the American people would demand the nation’s leader immediately answer for these disgusting actions, leaving him with absolutely no recourse but to resign from office. “Oh my god, I can’t imagine how bad it would be. The U.S. populace would never stand for something like that. If anything, the country would unite against a serial harasser. I would be raked through the coals for it, shunned forever from public life.” Trump added that luckily no women ever accused him of such depraved behavior during his campaign because, if they had, he most certainly would never have been elected president."
1360,"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging in advance that it was probably a silly question, Virginia congressman John Whitlock reportedly checked in real quick Friday with the Office of Congressional Ethics to make sure pressing his exposed penis against an intern doesn’t constitute sexual harassment. “Sorry if it’s the most obvious thing to ask about, but it’s cool if I suddenly unzip my pants and press my erection against a female intern’s body, right?” asked Whitlock, adding that he felt like he knew the answer already, but wanted to confirm, just to be safe, that laying his engorged penis upon the shoulder of an unsuspecting 19-year-old as she took notes in his office constituted “kosher workplace behavior.” “I know pinching her ass when I pass by and coming up from behind her to rub her shoulders is acceptable, but I don’t want to cross a line or anything, especially in this climate. Again, I’m sure it’s fine, but I just thought I’d do my due diligence and run it by you guys.” At press time, the ethics office was packed with dozens of other congressmen who had similar concerns and said it couldn’t hurt to double-check."
1361,"WASHINGTON—Following testimony by female lawmakers alleging widespread sexual misconduct throughout Capitol Hill, Paul Ryan announced Thursday that Congress will undergo new sexual harassment training to create a safe work environment and plausible deniability. “This comprehensive three-hour course is designed to promote a healthy workplace where women feel protected and ensure our hands are clean when senators or representatives are accused of sexual assault,” said the speaker of the House, noting that the mandatory training sessions would teach legislators how to recognize sexual harassment and provide the tools needed to brush off claims against individual congressmen. “This is a long-overdue step in covering our asses and also making sure the House and Senate are safe places for women to work. Once everyone has completed the training, we’ll be able to confidently claim we’ve done our most basic due diligence as new allegations surface.” At press time, Ryan was asking low-level staffers not to sign their bosses’ names to the training sign-in sheet if they were not actually present."
1362,"BURBANK, CA—Not having appeared together publicly since they said goodbye to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. back in January, the Obamas reunited for a live hour-long TBS primetime event Friday for the first time since leaving the White House. “Now, Barack, what if I told you that backstage I had some very familiar faces that you haven’t seen in some time—c’mon, let’s bring them on out!” said host Mario Lopez, as Michelle, Sasha, and Malia Obama stepped onto the set and waved to the live studio audience before walking over to the couch and taking turns politely hugging each other. “We’re so lucky to have everyone back together again! But before we get into what you’ve all been up to since the presidency ended, let’s take a look back at some of our favorite moments from the eight unforgettable years you welcomed America into your home.” At press time, the camera cut to dogs Bo and Sunny sitting in the audience after Lopez asked, “Hey, wait a second, aren’t we missing some folks?”"
1363,"WASHINGTON—In response to radio personality Leeann Tweeden’s allegations of being inappropriately groped by Al Franken during a 2006 U.S.O. tour, Democratic Party leaders issued calls Thursday for a convincing amount of condemnation for the Minnesota senator. “I urge my fellow Democrats to renounce Senator Franken’s unacceptable behavior in the absolute most plausible way,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, adding that he hadn’t ruled out taking steps to eventually look into the matter. “It’s imperative that we unequivocally go through the motions of rejecting any and all forms of sexual misconduct, and I’m confident that all Democrats will join me in denouncing the senator’s actions in the strongest believable terms.” Schumer also said that party leaders would remain steadfast in their lip service even if additional Democrats were accused of sexual assault."
1364,"WASHINGTON—Knowing that the commander-in-chief will be able to tell if there’s even a single thing in place, sources confirmed Tuesday that aides were frantically trying to restore chaos to the White House before President Trump returned from his 12-day diplomatic trip through Asia. “We have to make sure that everything is in just as much disarray as it was when he left, or he’ll be furious,” said White House aide Jeffrey Bertram, who told reporters he had spent all morning scattering highly sensitive documents throughout West Wing offices and hallways while other staffers hastily re-smeared ketchup on the Resolute desk and made sure the bust of Winston Churchill was once again lodged in the toilet tank of the guest lavatory off the Diplomatic Reception Room. “Fuck, I knew we shouldn’t have gone nuts with letting the place function while he was gone. I mean, we can fill the bathtubs with candy wrappers, rip up the carpets, and jam swords in the walls for a thousand years, but he’ll still notice that one thing that looks just a little bit organized. We are so dead.” At press time, a panicked Bertram had squirted the Oval Office drapes with lighter fluid and barely had them reignited when the president stepped into the Entrance Hall."
1365,"WASHINGTON—Both shouting “FBI, you’re under arrest!” as they grabbed hidden pistols from behind the refrigerator and the back of the pantry, Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump were reportedly holding each other at gunpoint in their kitchen Monday after simultaneously revealing their undercover identities. “I’m afraid you’re the one under arrest, sweetheart,” said Ivanka, as she and her husband warily circled the marble-topped kitchen island with their FBI badges held out and their weapons lethally trained on one another. “How about you just come quietly? If only one of us is getting out alive tonight, it’s not gonna be you.” At press time, authorities were reportedly leading the couple away in handcuffs after both were apprehended by Barron Trump, who had been tracking them undercover for the FBI for more than a year."
1366,"MONTGOMERY, AL—Waving off the current allegations against him as vicious attempts to sabotage his election bid, Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore told reporters Monday that the women accusing him of pedophilia were only doing so now because “shifting sociocultural norms have created an environment in which assault allegations are taken seriously.” “These women have had 30 years to come forward, and the one and only reason they’re speaking out now is because they suddenly have less fear that their lives will be utterly destroyed,” said Moore, adding that the women accusing him of sexually pursuing them as teenagers were just several of many “jumping on the sexual assault bandwagon these days” in light of meaningful systemic change and the fact that society would no longer immediately discredit them. “My accusers are nothing but slandering opportunists taking advantage of the deteriorating influence of the patriarchy that has traditionally silenced any woman who makes such claims. If the American public at large had not finally begun truly hearing victims and decided that enough was enough, I guarantee that these women would never have had the audacity to accuse me of such heinous crimes.” Moore went on to say that he would nevertheless continue his run for the Senate despite the charges against him because while the norms had shifted, they had not shifted nearly as much in Alabama."
1367,"WASHINGTON—Providing a glimpse into the difficulties of working within the organization during the 2016 presidential campaign, Democratic political strategist Donna Brazile told reporters Thursday that the Hillary Rodham Clinton High Palace Of The Solar Order was almost like a cult. “From the very beginning of the presidential race, the Hillary Rodham Clinton High Palace Of The Solar Order created a kind of insular environment that really didn’t tolerate the questioning of her absolute authority over all beings and things,” said Brazile, adding that the Order was often plagued by a cult-like atmosphere surrounding its anointed leader, especially in Clinton’s edict that she was always to be referred to by a 12-word formal title and the mandatory practice of all members gathering in the sweat lodge to zealously repeat “I’m With Her” for five hours every day. “Things got fairly weird around the primaries, when we had to take a vow of silence, and whenever she left the holy lair, everyone had to bow their heads and avoid looking at her as a sign of divine respect. And there was never really any effort within Order to offer dissenting views, especially after Hillary ordered Robby Mook to be shackled and displayed on one of the H altars as a warning to troublemakers.” Several reports indicate that Brazile was last seen being swarmed by a gang of purple-hooded assailants and thrown into the back of an old campaign bus emblazoned with a High Palace Of The Solar Order emblem."
1368,"WASHINGTON—Saying the financial risks and hours of hard work would pay off in the long term, former president Barack Obama revealed Thursday that he has sunk his entire life’s savings into the development of a tabletop game based on the American presidency. Obama confirmed that over the past 10 months, he has spent the bulk of his family’s net worth to createCommander In Chief: Executive Power, a hybrid role-playing and board game about running a presidential administration. He has reportedly devised more than 50 possible storylines players may encounter while they work together to complete a term in the Oval Office, planning fiscally sound federal budgets, negotiating trade deals with foreign countries, and delivering aid to states struck by natural disasters. “OnceCommander In Chiefhits the market, it’s gonna blow up just likeTerra Mysticadid, but right now funding is the biggest issue,” said Obama, sitting at his dining room table and showing off a prototype that included a 4-by-4 foot game board, stacks of handwritten index cards labeled “event” and “item,” and a set of polyhedral dice. “I drained our bank account to pay this specialty manufacturer to make the game components, and I’m hoping the Kickstarter money will cover the cost of renting warehouse space to store the finished product.” “I had to dip into Sasha’s college fund, so she may have to go to state school her first couple years,” the 44th president of the United States continued. “But once the game takes off and starts making money, she can transfer wherever she wants.” The former president described the game as “a fully immersive executive-branch adventure for players 12 and up” and said it has a playing time of approximately 20 hours. According to Obama, one player acts as the president, leading the administration through various challenges, while the other players work together as vice president, chief of staff, and various cabinet secretaries to implement policy initiatives and maintain the day-to-day agenda of the West Wing. Players reportedly must complete several side quests to keep the White House running, such as seeking Senate confirmations, hosting state dinners, and holding press conferences following national events such as mass shootings or holiday celebrations. Obama estimated thatCommander In Chiefwill sell for around $60 and will come with character sheets for players to track their stats, a 200-page hardcover “President’s Policy Guide” rulebook, and 15 pewter game pieces that include miniature replicas of the presidential seal, theResolutedesk, a manila briefing folder, and Uncle Sam. “[Former first lady] Michelle [Obama] has really been on my case lately about having this stuff all over the dining room,” Obama said as he scribbled an idea for a Camp David expansion pack on one of the large whiteboards he had mounted on the walls. “But she doesn’t understand how much money we have tied up in this thing. I took out a second mortgage on the house, and with the funds from that I should be able to get a booth at the next PAX gaming convention.” “Once people see how fun it is to craft and deliver their very own 90-minute State of the Union address covering every major issue in politics, they’re going to want to buy this,” he added, flipping through a legal pad filled with the game’s rules for appointing federal circuit judges. Obama admitted that he spends nearly all his free time working onCommander In Chief, often staying up until three or four in the morning drawing character art of suit-and-tie-wearing politicians and consulting online forums for advice on game mechanics, action-selection methods, and victory conditions. “I convinced Malia to beta-test it with me when she was home from school last weekend, but she said it wasn’t her thing,” Obama said. “We only made it to the midterm elections before her secretary of state character’s approval rating fell below 25 percent, knocking her out of the game. I got so into it I completely forgot about a speech I was supposed to give at Michelle’s Let Girls Learn event.” “She was pretty steamed, but once the orders start rolling in, she’ll see it was all worth it,” he added. At press time, Obama had reportedly dropped to his knees and begun shouting at former first dogs Bo and Sunny for shredding the game’s board and swallowing all its handmade playing pieces."

1370,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to avoid a potentially disrespectful or insensitive response, House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly quickly ran a tweet about the Texas mass shooting past Wayne LaPierre before posting the message, sources confirmed Monday. “Wayne, I understand that this is a delicate situation so I wanted to check to make absolutely sure you’re on board with this response before I send it out,” wrote Ryan, who pasted the 16-word draft urging Americans to send prayers to the people of Texas into an email for the NRA executive vice president to peruse and approve. “Obviously, I’d never want to write anything that might offend you or the National Rifle Association. If you don’t like the sentiment or there’s a different wording you’d prefer, just let me know and I can change it without delay. Also happy to provide a few options for you to select from if that would work better. Just let me know when you get a second.” After receiving LaPierre’s consent to post the tweet, Ryan reportedly assured the gun rights advocate that this would be his last public statement on the shooting."

And once we get there, I bet they’ll have a fun marble dragon you can play with. Wow! How cool does that sound?” At press time, White House staffers were forced to make changes to the president’s itinerary as they struggled in vain to pry his fingers from the bronze elephant he had smuggled onto the tarmac."

1373,"WASHINGTON—Stating that the new system is pursuant with the regulations laid out by the Affordable Care Act, the White House announced Friday that the government’s health insurance exchanges would now only be accessible from a single kiosk in a remote Iowa cornfield. “All Americans wishing to sign up for health insurance through the marketplace will now be able to do so by accessing a terminal conveniently located in the middle of a 60-acre cornfield just two hours North of Des Moines,” said White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, adding that the lone kiosk, which stands among the tall corn stalks about 2,000 yards off an unmarked road, would be open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. during the shortened enrollment period for anyone seeking to procure health coverage for 2018. “One kiosk centrally located in the United States will streamline the process of accessing the marketplace while also cutting costs. In just 135 paces northeast from the old tree stump in the middle of the field, you’ll be able to peruse the insurance options available for you and your family, except between noon and 3 p.m. on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the system undergoes scheduled maintenance. We recommend signing up early for those who live out of state as flights to Des Moines are limited.” At press time, sources confirmed that the new health exchange kiosk was currently out of order after being run over by a combine harvester."
1374,"WASHINGTON—Saying that the new organization would be aimed at upholding the political party’s standard of conduct and ideals, the Democratic National Committee unveiled Thursday the Clinton Institute For Campaign Ethics Reform in response to recent allegations of election rigging during the 2016 primary. “The DNC is taking these claims of misconduct very seriously, which is why we have founded, with the help of a generous $40 million donation from an anonymous benefactor, this new institute whose main focus will be to look into corruption claims like these,” said chairman Tom Perez, adding that a committee has been formed to review the party’s practices and will be led by former DNC chair and current democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who eagerly volunteered her services and intimate knowledge of the 2016 election. “The institute’s initial funding will go toward hiring numerous consultants, lawyers, and policy experts whose experience and advice will be essential in retooling the DNC to align with our value system as democrats and Americans.” At press time, the DNC announced plans to maintain the Clinton Institute’s independence by raising capital with several $30,000-per-plate fundraising dinners."
1375,"WASHINGTON—Swerving hard as it sped away down Pennsylvania Avenue, President Trump’s limousine reportedly gunned it around a corner and through the streets of the nation’s capital Thursday in a frantic attempt to throw special counsel Robert Mueller from its roof. Witnesses at the scene said the 73-year-old former FBI director—who is leading the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia—relentlessly pursued the presidential limo on foot and eventually heaved himself up onto the car, trying to question the commander in chief about his contacts with foreign entities known to have interfered in the 2016 election. “Go, go, go, go!” a Secret Service agent reportedly shouted from inside the heavily armored vehicle which, after pulling out of the White House gate, was seen hopping a curb and plowing through a row of hedges into Edward R. Murrow Park. “Come on! Floor it!” “Goddammit, he’s still up there,” the agent continued as Mueller began pounding on the back windshield and telling the president that he just needed some clarification on a few things. “We’ve got to shake him!” Sources said the driver made every effort to dislodge the special counsel, maneuvering between lanes, onto sidewalks, and through a barricaded construction zone, but Mueller managed to maintain his grip on the car, at one point clinging to a door handle with a single hand as the vehicle skidded around Dupont Circle. He was said to have appeared completely calm and expressionless as he held a written request for financial records up to the president’s tinted window, even when the limo zigzagged through the Georgetown University campus and accelerated to full speed over the Francis Scott Key bridge, sending pedestrians diving into the Potomac River. According to witnesses, when the driver hit the brakes to avoid running over a street vendor selling T-shirts, hats, and other patriotic memorabilia, Mueller was sent tumbling down onto the car’s hood, where, for the first time, the president and his men made eye contact with the prosecutor. “Hand over the documents, Mr. President,” Mueller said as the vehicle slammed into reverse, sideswiping a row of parked cars, careening through a crowd of Chinese tourists, and snapping off street signs as if they were twigs. “The U.S. Department of Justice has granted me broad subpoena powers in this matter. You’re better off just giving me the papers now. It’s not too late to come clean.” “You’re making a big mistake, sir,” Mueller added when the driver steered the limo into an alley and attempted to pin him against a dumpster. Reports from motorists indicated that most vehicles were able to veer out of the way as the president’s car bolted through traffic, though one tractor-trailer was confirmed to have swerved into an embankment and tipped onto its side, forcing the limo to abruptly change course and drive straight through the lobby of an office tower. As the car exited the building in a shower of sparks and falling debris, Mueller reportedly emerged unscathed, continuing to issue his demands for records relating to the Trump Organization’s worldwide financial holdings. “I just heard people screaming to get out of the way, and then this massive black car came barreling down the street,” said pedestrian Anna Stockworth, who estimated the limo was traveling at more than 100 mph when it clipped a newsstand and spun around in a full circle, its tires screeching and smoking as the special counsel was finally ejected from its roof. “I think that might have been the president!” Onlookers noted that after rolling across the pavement and lying motionless for several seconds, Mueller stood up, wiped a small trickle of blood from his mouth, straightened his tie, and then slowly and calmly walked back to his office."
1376,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to destroy as much incriminating evidence as possible following the indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, White House staffers reportedly spent Tuesday frantically shredding Trump campaign aides. “We should have done this months ago; we need to shred as many of these campaign aides as we can before Mueller gets his hands on them,” said senior policy advisor Stephen Miller, who directed employees to search the White House and hand over any damning campaign consultants while he manned the industrial shredder, stopping occasionally to un-jam the machine. “Oh god, there’s just so many of them. This could open us up to a lot of bad things. It’s gonna take all day to destroy the staffers we have here, plus there’s still a bunch in New York.” At press time, Miller reportedly started a bonfire on the South Lawn after deciding it would be much faster to burn the enormous pile of campaign aides his team had collected."
1377,"WASHINGTON—Armed with all the special tools they’d need for the mission, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. on Wednesday were reportedly attempting to build a tunnel from the White House South Lawn to FBI Headquarters in order to free Paul Manafort from custody. “We’re gonna sneak into the jail from below, rescue him, and escape before the guards know what hit them,” said Eric Trump as he and his older brother sat on their hands and knees, scraping at the grass and dirt with soup spoons they had taken from the kitchen and a trowel they had found in the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden. “We’ll use the firecrackers to blow a hole in the floor of his prison cell. Then, once we’ve nabbed him, we’ll throw down thumbtacks behind us in case they try to chase us back to the White House. If we skip dinner, I bet we can make it there by nightfall, so we’d better get some snacks too.” Upon learning Manafort was placed under house arrest, the brothers reportedly abandoned their 4-inch hole in the lawn, but said they’d finish the escape tunnel next time the FBI kidnapped someone."
1378,"DOVER, DE—Telling his only trick-or-treater to “hang tight a sec while Uncle Joe scares up some Halloween goodies,” former Vice President Joe Biden reportedly disappeared and returned 10 minutes later with a warm can of GT Cola, sources confirmed Friday. “Here ya go, bud. Thought I could hook you up with a spare ramen flavor packet, but I must’ve gotten a mean case of the munchies—didn’t bargain on any other visitors when I left on the porch light for my main squeeze,” said Biden, cautioning the child that she might want to give the rim a quick rinse first, since the garage fridge where he found the soda can was “kind of on the blink.” “That’s a badass little getup you’re sportin’ there. Reminds me of the time I caught Poison’s ’86 Halloween show dressed as a California Raisin. I don’t remember jack except ending the night with a naughty nurse I met backstage, though I coulda saved myself a fat lip if I knew she was banging Bret Michaels, too.” According to sources, Biden then darted back into his house after remembering he had just bought a “shit-ton” of caramel edibles."
1379,"BALTIMORE—In light of his recent comments praising Confederate general Robert E. Lee and attributing the origin of the Civil War to “a lack of an ability to compromise,” the NAACP announced Tuesday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly would lose his seat on the organization’s board of directors. “Despite his many years of service on behalf of the African American community, General Kelly’s statements are incompatible with the NAACP’s core mission of equality for all persons, making his leadership role no longer appropriate,” said chairman Leon W. Russell, adding that Kelly, who also characterized Lee as “an honorable man,” would stay on in a strictly advisory capacity. “We will always honor General Kelly for his almost 40 years of service to this organization and to African Americans more broadly. While he will no longer serve on our board, we are certain the he will continue his lifelong crusade for racial justice.” At press time, several Confederacy heritage groups had offered Kelly key positions in their organizations, though admitting they were just as surprised as anyone else."
1380,"WASHINGTON—After issuing indictments against former Trump campaign associates Paul Manafort and Rick Gates on Monday, a teary-eyed Robert S. Mueller III reportedly whispered, “I’ll make those bastards pay,” into a locket containing a photo of James Comey. “I’ll never forget what those sons of bitches did to you,” said the special counsel, his voice trembling as a teardrop fell upon the small silver case that held a black-and-white photo and lock of hair from the former FBI director. “I won’t stop until every last one of them gets what they deserve. Don’t you worry, my dear James.

According to sources, Defense Secretary James Mattis and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were reviewing a presentation on troop mobility in Afghanistan when the Trump boys, who wore rain boots and had secured throw pillows to their legs and arms with belts, burst into the White House Situation Room to announce they had trained for an entire day and were ready to deploy to North Korea to “kill King Jong-un.”“We did all the basic training and now we can do combat stuff!” said Donald Jr., who dropped to the ground to do a commando roll underneath the conference room table before hopping to his feet, readjusting the metal colander on his head, and turning to salute the chief of naval operations. “I’ve mastered 10 kinds of kicks, including some ninja ones.”“We’re gonna stomp their nukes,” Eric Trump added as he lifted his foot and attempted to crush an empty soda can, which soon became stuck to his heel.White House staff confirmed that earlier in the day, the Trump boys had been observed in the Treaty Room setting up a homemade obstacle course, which included two rows of wastebaskets intended for tire drills and a series of couches that one had to leap across without touching the floor. The final leg of the course was said to have started in the State Dining Room, where the boys crawled on their stomachs through a tunnel of chair legs before shooting a rubber band at an 1804 oil painting of Dolley Madison and sprinting down the hallway to touch the mantel in the East Room.The Trump boys reportedly showed off their skills to the silent military leaders, with Eric performing nine sit-ups in a row while Donald Jr. landed several blows on an empty office chair using a potato masher as a sword. Sources said the brothers then began to demonstrate their hand-to-hand combat techniques and grappled with each other until Eric tripped over four-star general and Marine Corps commandant Robert Neller’s chair, hitting the floor and getting the wind knocked out of him.“We’re gonna parachute into the jungle and then sneak into Pong-gong [sic],” said Eric Trump, removing the catcher’s mask he had been wearing to reveal camouflage face paint made from the blue-shimmer and coral colors he found in first lady Melania Trump’s eye shadow palettes. “We’re really good at hiding. And we invented a secret code—if one of us is in trouble, we make a bird call, and the bad guys can’t tell it’s us.”“Ca-caw!” he added.Unrolling a piece of construction paper on the table, the Trump boys revealed a hand-drawn map of North Korea, which they had reportedly depicted as a green square completely surrounded by blue water and fiery explosions. The page also included what appeared to be the boys’ battle plan, a series of bullet-points reading, “Spy. Get the plans. Escape in helicopter.”Several sources indicated that the Trump boys then handed Mattis a list of supplies they would need shipped to North Korea for their mission, including two M1 Abrams battle tanks, their very own dog tags, red headbands, a crate of assault rifles, boxes of Little Debbie snack cakes, a carton of pizza-flavored Goldfish crackers, juice boxes, and something they referred to as a “laser stealth boat.”“We practiced guns really hard, and now we’re awesome at shooting,” said Eric Trump, pulling up a video on his phone of the brothers making machine gun noises as they stood on the North Lawn driveway and used a garden hose nozzle to spray at a chalk drawing of angry-looking faces labeled “Bad Guys.” “Our aim is super good.”“We can do arrows, too,” added Donald Jr., pulling a carbon-fiber arrow from a quiver on his back and loading the compound bow he had recently received as a birthday gift from his father.At press time, White House staff reported a screaming Eric Trump was seen running through the West Wing with an arrow lodged in the couch cushion strapped to his chest."
1382,"WASHINGTON—Revealing that newly discovered ads and online articles could have been part of a coordinated campaign, a startling new report released Friday found evidence that Democrats may have attempted to influence the 2016 presidential election. “Although it’s unclear if the efforts had any impact, it seems plausible that a loosely connected series of social media posts and grassroots word-of-mouth campaigns about the 2016 election could have originated in the Democratic Party,” said report author Michelle Lipkin, citing several clandestine pro-Clinton ad buys on Facebook and a small-scale, mostly ineffectual anti-Trump research endeavor that was indirectly traced back to several DNC donors. “It’s shocking in the least to discover the DNC dropped hundreds of thousands of dollars to shape the American democratic process; however, we are confident this hidden attempt at influencing the election had little to no effect on the final vote totals.” Lipkin also warned it was entirely possible that the Democrats might attempt to interfere in the 2020 election as well."
1383,"EAST HANOVER, NJ—Utterly perplexed as to how they were chosen for the massive project, Nabisco executives reportedly were baffled Thursday after the Trump administration gave it a $200 million contract to rebuild Puerto Rico’s roads. “Although we are honored the president has awarded us this generous contract to help the people of Puerto Rico rebuild their transportation infrastructure, we honestly have no idea how to do this,” said Irene Rosenfeld, CEO of Nabisco parent company Mondelēz International, adding that although she explained to administration officials that the undertaking was entirely out of her company’s wheelhouse as a snack food manufacturer, she was told simply to “figure it out.” “We repeatedly tried to convince them to give the money to a construction firm, but all they said was that this order came directly from the president himself. In its entire history, this company has only ever produced cookies and crackers, but I guess we can give it a shot for all the Puerto Ricans who desperately need assistance.” At press time, Nabisco’s team was evaluating whether Nilla Wafers or Oreos would be a better building material for the muddy, sandy terrain of San Juan."
1384,"WASHINGTON—Stating conclusively that the meddling was “negligible at best,” TruthBeacon.org, an entirely new website created eight minutes ago, declared that Russian interference had no impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. “Experts have determined without a doubt that there is absolutely no truth to allegations that Russian interference, which was limited to a handful of barely viewed social media ads, influenced the outcome of last year’s election,” read the website that was reportedly registered last night and began rapidly publishing content for the very first time less than 10 minutes ago. “Also, all the investigations into collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia have been unable to scrape together a single piece of evidence over the last year. Millions of taxpayer dollars wasted in what is decisively a witch hunt!” According to sources, TruthBeacon.org had crashed five minutes ago due to overwhelming traffic."
1385,"WASHINGTON—Staring out at the thick, foreboding jungle, a covert military intelligence unit sailed their patrol boat up an overgrown, booby-trapped stretch of the Potomac River in search of a deranged Gen. John F. Kelly, sources confirmed Wednesday. According to the boat’s crew, the small detachment of soldiers had been dispatched on classified orders from high within the U.S. military’s chain of command to locate the retired general and current White House chief of staff, who was rumored to have gone insane after traveling upriver to join the Trump administration months ago. “No one ever sails this deep into Washington, but that’s where Kelly’s gone, and that’s where we’re headed to track him down,” said the attack craft’s commanding officer Capt. Joseph Collins as the vessel passed silently through a narrow stretch of the river where the Lincoln Memorial towered above the canopy and the banks were lined with hidden rows of sharpened punji stakes. “When they gave us this mission, they filled us all in on Kelly’s background. He’s a four-star general, the military’s scion son, sent to bring order and stability to the White House. But I guess something inside him must have just snapped.” “God knows what happens to a man when he’s been in this environment so long,” Collins added, as the crew nervously scanned the mist-shrouded shoreline for signs of an ambush. Several reports indicated that the Navy patrol boat reached the American 14th Street Bridge outpost at approximately midnight and encountered a visibly dazed serviceman who made the weary crew’s “blood run cold” while recalling the traumatic events witnessed in the nation’s capital, describing Washington, D.C. as the “world’s asshole.” In addition, the commanding officer briefly considered turning back after spotting the mutilated body of Reince Priebus floating down the Potomac, but ultimately decided to continue the mission. Anonymous intelligence sources reported that Kelly’s tenure as chief of staff had begun with optimism that the general’s tactics could change the course of the struggling Trump administration. However, military leaders soon became concerned after Kelly’s daily status reports grew increasingly gruesome and incoherent, often including rambling philosophical passages on the fundamental chaos of human nature as well as graphic photographs of the summary executions of suspected rogue staffers. Military officials reportedly made the decision to track Kelly down after a September incident in which the former Department of Homeland Security secretary had reportedly begun a briefing by tossing the severed heads of multipleWashington Postreporters into the White House press pool. “You try not to think about some of the things you’ve heard about him, like how he supposedly wears a necklace made from the tongues of White House leakers,” said the boat’s seaman David “Stretch” Trudeau, adding that the crew had heard reports that a previous ship sent on their mission had disappeared, with rumors that the soldiers aboard had all joined forces with Kelly. “It’s hard to imagine what could make one of the most respected strategic minds of his generation throw away a five-decade military career like this, but then again, who knows what it’s like to be that deep inside this administration.” “They should never have left him out here like this,” Trudeau continued. At press time, the crew had reportedly emerged from thick underbrush onto the White House South Lawn to find Kelly standing amidst a circle of his followers ritualistically slaughtering a trussed, naked Senator Bob Corker (R-TN)."
1386,"WASHINGTON—Confirming that the 71-year-old had officially been determined fit to carry out his duty, officials from the United States Army announced Monday that President Trump was being called upon to serve in Vietnam after the last of his draft deferments had expired. “After almost 50 years of filing and renewing dozens of military service waivers, the President’s final term of postponement has concluded and he will be required to fulfill his military commitment immediately,” said Public Affairs Chief Brig. Gen. Paul Johnson, explaining that the commander-in-chief had finally been deemed able to serve after decades of claiming ineligibility to do so based on college enrollment, bone spurs, diabetes, hepatitis, religious opposition, and homosexuality. “President Trump will be sent to Fort Benning, Georgia to complete his basic officer training, whereafter he will be deployed to Vietnam along with his infantry division and stationed near Danang to begin his year-long service obligation.” At press time, sources confirmed that the president was last seen aboard Air Force One, embarking on a trip of unknown duration in Canada."
1387,"WASHINGTON—Realizing with a shudder that he was being watched, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt reportedly picked up his pace while walking home Tuesday as hundreds of whooping cranes began silently perching around him. “Stay calm, Scott, they’re just birds,” said Pruitt, fumbling for his house keys as flock after flock of the birds soundlessly alighted upon tree branches, fence posts, and rooftops along his route. “Oh fuck, what do they want? Okay, don’t make eye contact. Just keep walking. Keep going. Shit, shit, shit!” Sources later confirmed that Pruitt sprinted the rest of the way home only to find a dozen more of the birds quietly waiting for him in his living room."
1388,"WASHINGTON—Fumbling over his words before meandering into an anecdote about his newest golf course, sources confirmed Thursday that President Donald Trump asked the mother of a fallen soldier to remind him what they were talking about 15 seconds into their phone conversation. “So, uh, wait—what was I just saying?” the commander-in-chief reportedly said moments after offering his condolences to the woman before quickly placing the phone receiver on the Resolute Desk and asking a nearby advisor to remind him who he was calling. “Oh yeah, your son? He did military stuff, right?” At press time, sources confirmed Trump was quickly wrapping up the conversation by telling the woman on the other end of the line that he was counting on her vote for his tax reform plan."
1389,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to alleviate her sorrow after the tragic event, President Donald Trump reportedly comforted the grieving widow of a fallen soldier Thursday by assuring her that he will never die. “I know things are very difficult for you right now, but I hope you can take some solace in the knowledge that I am going to live on forever,” said Trump in a phone call to Deborah Stilling, attempting to sooth the woman who lost her spouse in Afghanistan with promises that he would outlast her, her children, and her children’s children. “Yes, your husband is gone, but remember that the commander-in-chief he served will always remain, and no one can ever take that away from you. Dry your eyes; I’m still here.” At press time, Trump, who was reportedly unsuccessful in lifting the widow’s spirits, offered repeated assurances that he would thrive long after the sun had expanded into a red giant and swallowed the Earth."

1391,"WASHINGTON—Alarmed by the sudden change in his thinking and behavior, White House aides said Tuesday that they were concerned about President Trump’s declining mental health after he admitted he may not be an omnipotent living god. “The president has always been completely clearheaded about his status as the supreme being, so we naturally began to suspect something wasn’t right when he started openly doubting that he was the creator and eternal master of existence,” said Trump staffer Greg Fairfield, adding that he sincerely hoped that the president was just tired or under stress on those occasions when he second-guessed his status as an all-knowing, all-seeing divinity. “It’s just these little moments here or there where he mutters something like, ‘Maybe the universe didn’t spring forth from my essence,’ that make us worry he’s not quite there. I mean, that’s just not who he is.” At press time, aides feared that Trump may never regain his faculties when he declared he was merely a demigod who would die after holding the presidency for a thousand years."

We’ve also marshaled our resources to ensure that the people of Puerto Rico receive this nothing as soon as possible, and they should expect absolutely nothing at all to begin arriving within days.” Sanders went on to say that the Trump administration was also petitioning Congress to pass legislation that would allocate 75.5 billion nothing to help Puerto Rico with ongoing rebuilding efforts."
1394,"WASHINGTON—Springing into action the moment their SCOTUS wristwatch transponders signaled the alert, all nine members of the U.S. Supreme Court reportedly gathered in their top-secret subterranean chambers Friday to receive their latest directive from the giant holographic head of former Chief Justice John Marshall. After racing into the Supreme Court Building and seating themselves on the bench in order of seniority, current Chief Justice John Roberts and his eight associate justices are said to have raised their right hands and exclaimed, “We, the Guardians of Liberty!” Then, sources said, a lever activated by pulling down the scales on a marble statue of Lady Justice dropped them into nine separate chutes, through which they slid down toward the high-tech underground command center where the disembodied face of the early 19th-century jurist briefs them on new missions. “Justices, it seems there’s trouble afoot with the regulatory oversight of interstate commerce, and we need your special combination of skills to resolve the matter,” the 20-foot hologram of John Marshall said as the court members arrived in the massive titanium-lined bunker and stood attentively in a circle around him, their arms crossed or akimbo. “Justice Kagan, we’ll need your disciplined jurisprudence and opinion-writing powers. Justice Thomas, we need the full strength of your textualist interpretations. And Chief Justice Roberts, we’ll count on you to hold any noncompliant parties in contempt of this court. Only with the combined powers of the Nine can we fairly interpret precedent and the Constitution as it applies to U.S. law.” “Now, gaze into the Globe ofA Fortiori!” Marshall added as hundreds of holographs of appellate filings appeared in a mist-filled sphere in the room’s center. “Remember: The fate of federal shipping regulation depends upon you!” Marshall reportedly summoned the justices at 8:38 p.m., forcing many to abandon their grocery shopping, trips to the opera, and scouting missions high above the D.C. skyline, which they regularly patrol in the Habeas Copter. According to sources, Justice Alito hurriedly pulled on his black robe, turned to the beautiful Swiss model lying in the bed of his Alpine château, and said, “I’m sorry, justice has called.” Meanwhile, Justice Ginsburg, who was spotted shooting pool at the Foggy Bottom Roadhouse, was said by witnesses to have sunk her last shot, grabbed a large pile of bills off the table’s rail, and thanked a group of scowling gang members for their generosity before hopping on her Kawasaki Ninja EX300 and tearing off down Constitution Avenue. Speaking on condition of anonymity, several Supreme Court clerks told reporters their bosses are routinely summoned by the projection of the nation’s longest-serving chief justice, who is now in his third century of contacting court members, often in the middle of the night, to handle juridical emergencies relating to matters such as contract law, commercial litigation, patent disputes, arbitration agreements, and more. “I warn you, this will be your most crucial mission yet—you’ll need these tools of the judiciary to protect yourselves,” Marshall said as nine golden gavels descended from the ceiling into the justices’ outstretched hands. “Not since last year’sKansas v. Carrmission, when we lost our beloved colleague Justice Scalia, have we faced a challenge like this.” “May the powers of Article III watch over you all,” Marshall added before his hologram burst into smoke and the chamber filled with light. Sources confirmed the Supreme Court’s robotic clerk, Amicus, then stumbled into the room with a rickety cart of case files, prompting the justices to roll their eyes. The hapless automaton exclaimed, “Oh, heavens!” and knocked to the floor hundreds of pages of applicable documents fromUnited States v. Lopez,Wickard v. Filburn, and the Agriculture Adjustment Act of 1938. Having received their briefing, the highest-ranking members of the federal judiciary spent a few moments inside the Certiorari Pod—a glowing, neon-green capsule that allows the justices to communicate telepathically, debating the merits of a case at light speed—and then assembled on a round elevator platform emblazoned with the seal of the Supreme Court. “Well, team, you heard Marshall: It sounds like we’ve got our deliberations cut out for us,” Roberts said as the elevator brought the justices back up to the courtroom. “But if I know one thing, it’s that injustice can never win when we work together as a team—and, yeah, I mean you, too, Amicus. Now repeat after me: Equal justice under the law!” “Equal justice under the law!” the jurists shouted as they joined their gavels together in a triumphant salute and then slammed them down in unison. At press time, officials confirmed the Supreme Court had declined to render a verdict on the case, sending the decision back down to the Fourth Circuit for further consideration."
1395,"WASHINGTON—Saying the measure would radically curtail access to the procedure except under the most urgent conditions, House Republicans on Wednesday introduced legislation that would sharply limit abortions to those necessary to save a promising political career. “This bill amends the federal criminal code to redesignate abortion as illegal except in extraordinarily rare cases where a politician’s future as an elected representative is in jeopardy,” read a joint statement from the House GOP, explaining that unless there was no other way to ensure that a young legislator could continue rising through the ranks in D.C., the bill would bar women unconditionally from terminating a pregnancy. “Abortion is a sin, but we recognize that there may be no other alternative when fulfilling lifelong political ambitions is at risk. That is why this bill is so important to pass into law.” At press time, the bill was amended to clarify that the political careers in question were men’s and that any pregnant female politicians would be required to bring pregnancies to full-term."
1396,"WASHINGTON—Deflecting questions in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Las Vegas that killed 59 people and injured over 500 more, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters Tuesday that this is not the geologic era in which to debate gun control. “Out of respect for the families of the victims, we’re going to hold off on engaging in discourse over the regulation of firearms for a few eons,” said Sanders, adding that it would be premature to discuss enacting any sort of policies to prevent mass shootings until the next ice age has set in, likely long after the extinction of the human race. “Once the nation has had time to properly grieve and the continents have completed millions of years of tectonic migration to collide into one supercontinent, then we can bring this issue to the table. However, until a new dominant species rules the earth, it’s just not appropriate to address this issue.” At press time, Sanders said that a more realistic time to discuss gun control was after the sun expanded into its red giant stage and engulfed the planet."
1397,"As our nation struggles to come to grips with the horrible tragedy in Las Vegas, it’s only natural for people to search for an explanation of how an atrocity like this could have happened and to call on their elected officials to take measures to prevent such terrible bloodshed from occurring again in the future. Unfortunately, however, we’ve seen enough of these incidents to know that some people will rush to blame firearms for this carnage and will demand that Congress enact sweeping gun restrictions, engaging in misguided efforts that completely miss the underlying reasons behind the violence we’re seeing. The simple truth is, mass shootings like this aren’t about gun control we refuse to pass. They’re about access to mental health care that we will continue to gut. You can already hear the calls from the left. In the aftermath of this mass murder, millions of people are once again pushing for an assault weapons ban that I won’t allow lawmakers to give even a moment of consideration, let alone bring to a vote. If these folks actually examined the realities of the issue, they would see that the real culprit in these incidents is, and always has been, our country’s inadequate mental healthcare system that leaves troubled, potentially violent individuals without the support they need, and which my colleagues and I have spent most of our careers seeking, often successfully, to defund. The reason we have tragedies like this is because of how our healthcare system that I am dead set on undermining fails to serve Americans in desperate need of psychological treatment. Not because of a lack of gun ownership regulations, the slightest toughening of which will never even receive a single second of debate on the floor of the House on my watch. Case in point, I’ve seen commentators cite the GOP bill to loosen restrictions on silencers that is currently making its way through Congress as contributing to an environment where these shootings will continue to occur, an erroneous line of reasoning that completely ignores how our party’s many active attempts to repeal Obamacare would make it significantly harder, if not impossible, for millions of unwell individuals to visit mental health specialists and receive the treatment necessary to keep their erratic behavior in check. If we as a nation are really serious about preventing future tragedies, we shouldn’t focus on regulating so-called gun sale loopholes and outlawing high-capacity magazines, the very mention of which will elicit an overwhelming and immediate nullifying response should it be breathed on the floor of the House. Instead, we need to pay attention to the fact that many people with treatable mental illnesses struggle to afford medication or therapy, and then work around the clock to ensure that their meager options only dwindle further and become more expensive.Thatis where we need to be focused as a nation. If we’re going to get anywhere, we must see this problem for what it truly is: a nationwide mental health crisis that my policies have allowed to metastasize and that I am working continuously to exacerbate. Not some issue of who can and can’t buy guns, all legislation about which I, along with the powerful resources of supportive lobbyists, have suppressed with exceptional efficiency. Because as easy as it is to blame this unconscionable loss of human life on background check laws designed to maximize the profits of the gun industry at the expense of public safety, the real fault lies with healthcare legislation designed to maximize insurance industry profits at the expense of public safety. Remember, it’s not guns we’ve deliberately removed all barriers to owning that kill people. It’s people to whom we continually deny basic care that kill people."
1398,"CORAL GABLES, FL—In an attempt to tell the story of his failed candidacy in his own words, former Florida governor Jeb Bush has rented out a local black box theater and debuted a one-man show that chronicles the tragedy of his 2016 presidential campaign, sources reported Thursday. According to those in attendance opening night, the two-act solo piece, entitledJeb? (Or: The Rise And Fall Of An Honest, Consensus-Building Conservative), traces the 64-year-old’s path from well-heeled Republican frontrunner to presidential also-ran in a 150-minute performance that features monologues, character vignettes, musical interludes, and a 10-minute interpretive dance sequence in which Bush starts out as an egg and then goes on to reenact his childhood. Clad in a black T-shirt and black jeans, the onetime White House hopeful reportedly moves barefoot across the stage, which, apart from a single lectern, is completely empty. “Why, you might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when people expected big things from me—though I don’t suppose you’d want to hear about that, would you?” Bush wonders aloud during an early scene, speaking as an elderly version of himself and hobbling downstage with a cane in his hand. “Well, believe it or not, I once stood before a crowd of cheering people who were awfully excited to hear me say, ‘I’m a candidate for president of the United States of America.’” “Here I am now—it’s June 2015, I’m in Miami, and I’ve just announced my campaign,” continues Bush, mimicking the roar of the crowd as he mimes shaking supporters’ hands and kissing babies. “Yessir, I had the whole world on a string: I’d come up with a strong message about jobs and immigration, and folks had given my Super PAC more than a hundred million bucks. My friends and I thought the future was just waiting for us to reach out and grab it. My God, we were so naïve! Standing before all those bright lights and flashing cameras, I had gone blind.” Theater patrons confirmed that the show, which runs three nights a week through Dec. 20 at the Gables Playhouse Upstairs Stage, includes a monologue in which candidate Bush, puffing out his chest, speaks confidently about how he will undo President Barack Obama’s policies. Soon, however, the stage lights begin rapidly flickering on and off, his words grow more and more confused, and he wanders out into the aisles of the theater mumbling incoherent syllables into the ears of audience members. Another memorable scene reportedly finds Bush reenacting the third Republican presidential debate: slouching forward and affecting the Jersey dialect of Chris Christie, then smirking and taking on a sharp nasal tone to impersonate Ted Cruz. Sources said Bush quickly jumps from one part of the stage to another, cycling faster and faster through the personas of all 10 GOP candidates until the scene, like the debate itself, devolves into chaos. Attendees noted that Bush saves his most damning portrayal for Donald Trump, ending each of his chief antagonist’s lines by whispering, “Lies, lies, lies.” As the Trump character berates him with insults, Bush slowly moves upstage, making himself smaller and smaller and eventually curling up into a fetal position. “You’ve lost New Hampshire, you’ve lost Iowa, it all comes down to South Carolina,” Bush says in the play’s final moments, repeatedly shouting “South Carolina, here we come!” at the top of his lungs as he drags the lectern upstage and stands behind it. “The people have voted. The returns are in. Fourth place. A crushing, humiliating defeat. It’s all over. My journey has ended.” “What a poison draught to swallow,” continues Bush, a spotlight slowly contracting until only his anguished face is visible as he falls to his knees and grasps frantically at his hair. “What a bitter pill. And why, why was I forsaken? What manner of country would bleed a man dry, suck the very marrow from his bones, then cast him aside like so many broken playthings? O, perfidy! O, pride! I’m sorry, big brother! I’m sorry, Father! And I’m sorry, Mr. Reagan—to you most of all. I feel the rushing tide of history leaving me to drown in its wake. Yet here, so close to the end, I also find the veil has been lifted, and I can see beyond to catch a glimpse of this nation’s future. Shall I tell you what I see? Oh, don’t ask it! For the vision in my mind’s eye is no shining city on a hill. No, I see only darkness. I see destruction. I see death. God bless America, and God help us all.” Theater ushers confirmed a section of front-row seats that had been roped off and reserved for members of the Bush family remained empty throughout the performance."

1400,"WASHINGTON—A crazed grin spreading across his face as his eyes darted wildly from one paramedic to another, sources said Tuesday that a babbling Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell demanded that the EMTs loading him onto a stretcher outside the Capitol vote ‘Yes’ on the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill. “Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight, and the American people have suffered enough under its tyranny—we must take action!” shouted McConnell, launching into a speech he had reportedly planned to make on the Senate floor but was now delivering to the two medical technicians strapping his arms to a gurney and preparing to administer an IV. “The time is now to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with a plan that will cost less and restore freedom to the states! We cannot delay any longer! We cannot delay!” At press time, McConnell’s motion for a roll call vote was muffled by the oxygen mask being placed over his mouth."
1401,"WASHINGTON—Saying it was the first step in gaining the confidence and stability he would need to reintegrate back into society, residents and staff on Thursday welcomed former White House strategist Sebastian Gorka to New Beginnings, a halfway house for fired Trump administration members. The 20-bed residential treatment center, which opened earlier this year in the capital’s quiet Woodland Park neighborhood, reportedly offers round-the-clock care to traumatized former West Wing insiders, providing life skills training, wellness workshops, and psychotherapy under the guidance of licensed social workers. “It’s true these guys got wrapped up with the wrong people, but I firmly believe everyone has value no matter badly they’ve screwed up their lives.” “At New Beginnings, Mr. Gorka will have the chance to make a fresh start—a chance to reflect on his past actions and hopefully emerge a more responsible citizen,” said director Ross Woodley, who noted that besides housing, the facility offered counseling on issues from anger management to speaking with special prosecutors. “No doubt he’s been through a lot, but he’ll be joining a community of other ex-Trump strategists, senior advisors, and communications personnel who are all going through the same process.” “It’s very lucky we were able to accommodate him, though, as we’ve been completely full since February,” he added. According to Woodley, once accepted to the program, a jittery, confused Gorka was driven from the White House directly to the facility to begin treatment. During the intake process, Gorka’s personal belongings were reportedly confiscated and he was asked to sign forms promising not to visit the Oval Office or have any contact with his enabling friends still within the administration. Sources said that Gorka, 46, has responded well to the facility’s regimented schedule, rising before dawn to brew coffee and make breakfast for the group with former communications director Michael Dubke. Additionally, sources noted that Gorka had bonded with long-term resident Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who showed him how to do his own laundry and helped him buy a bus pass so he could apply for dishwashing jobs around town. “It’s a good sign that he’s interacting with people—that’s more than we could say for Spicer or Priebus when they got here,” said Woodley, pointing to the two men quietly completing a 1,000-piece winter landscape jigsaw puzzle. “Sean was just a mess. One moment he’d be manically scrawling press releases on the backs of napkins, and the next he’d be screaming in your face, saying that CNN was out to destroy his reputation. Reince has been in and out of a catatonic stupor since he arrived.” “Yes, it’s true these guys got wrapped up with the wrong people, but I firmly believe everyone has value no matter badly they’ve screwed up their lives, or their family’s lives, or the lives of 314 million Americans,” he continued. According to Woodley, some of the biggest breakthroughs are made during group therapy where twice a day, former officials gather in the facility’s activity room to discuss tense moments working for the administration and how they might have handled them differently. He noted that while some residents reportedly take weeks to admit the things they’ve done, most eventually build up the courage to share their stories, often breaking down into sobs. Woodley also explained that all residents are required to follow a strict code of conduct: no drugs or alcohol, no guest appearances on cable news, and a tidy bunk at all times. According to staff, however, abiding by the rules has been especially tough for Steve Bannon, whose attempts to conduct Breitbart editorial meetings via a smuggled cell phone have led to his loss of commissary privileges. “Bannon is incredibly volatile, so we’ve had to put him on a 24/7 watch to ensure he doesn’t injure himself or others,” said Woodley, adding that the president’s former chief strategist had recently thrown an ashtray at a TV after watching a Fox News segment he considered “bullshit establishment propaganda.” “We thought maybe he’d turned a corner when he found a job as a busboy at a nearby pub, but then he lost it by referring to several waitresses as ‘dykes.’” While rehabilitation has been easier for some residents than others, Woodley said former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was his biggest success story to date, noting that, after several weeks of intense rage counseling, he had fully accepted responsibility for his chaotic 10-day tenure and would soon be starting a new job at an Arlington landscaping company. “Though we wish for everyone to have the same level of success as Anthony, we accept it’s not always possible,” said Woodley. “There are only so many resources, and more and more people show up at our doorstep every day.” “Unfortunately, without our guidance, there’s really no future for these folks,” he continued. “People just don’t want Trump staffers living in their neighborhoods.”"
1402,"WASHINGTON—Increasingly optimistic that the callousness they required would be locked down by the September 30 deadline, GOP leaders were confident Wednesday that they will have the cruelty necessary to pass their new healthcare bill. “While we were nearly there on our previous attempts, with this go-around we’re all but certain we have the savagery we need for this measure to move forward,” said bill coauthor Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), adding that the utter contempt for the lives of middle class and poor Americans appeared to be “falling into place nicely.” “I’m not saying that lining up the wanton disregard for human suffering will be easy, but I’m more and more persuaded that it will be there when this bill ultimately comes to the floor.” At press time, Graham was meeting with several key undecideds, confident they just needed a bit more coaxing before fully pledging their inhumanity."
1403,"WASHINGTON—Saying she only had two years left to find a “real career,” White House Communications Director Hope Hicks was reportedly praying Friday that she wouldn’t be in the same shitty job by the time she hit 30. “Overseeing President Trump’s public relations strategy is fine for now as a placeholder, but if I’m still doing this in a couple years, that’s gonna be really embarrassing,” said Hicks, adding that while she was interested in working in journalism or maybe television production, she would certainly go to graduate school for business if the only alternative was “rotting away in this dead-end gig.” “There are guys still here in their 40s, and they just seem so unhappy. I can’t let that happen to me. I gotta get out of here if I ever want to make something of myself.” Hicks went on to say she’d be surprised if her miserable boss didn’t call it quits even before she did."
1404,"WASHINGTON—Saying he needed a break from constantly watching over the commander-in-chief to make sure he didn’t get into any trouble, visibly exhausted Chief of Staff John Kelly reportedly sat President Trump down in front of a White House television Friday and put on aTucker Carlsonepisode in order to get a quick hour to himself. “I can’t take my eye off him for one second without him getting into some policy issue he’s not supposed to be touching, so sometimes I just have to throw on a show he likes to get him to sit and behave for a little while,” said Kelly, rubbing his temples and explaining how he was “completely wiped out” from dealing with temper tantrums and cleaning up a variety of messes the president had made throughout day, and how he was desperate for a brief moment of peace and quiet to recuperate. “I just grabbed him a baggie of Goldfish and put on the episode where Tucker talks about his crowd size in West Virginia—the president loves that one. He calms right down and just stares at the screen for an hour straight. I’ve tried to get him to sit quietly with a book, but it’s no use. His TV shows are the only thing that can hold his attention long enough for me to get a minute to sit down and take a breath.” At press time, the chief of staff, who had reportedly nodded off on the Oval Office couch, awoke to find President Trump running through the West Wing screaming wildly about the nation’s borders."
1405,"AUSTIN, TX—Predicting a long, hard road ahead before the discourse was in anything approaching satisfactory condition, Texas governor Greg Abbott warned Thursday that it could be decades before the state was fully ready to talk about climate change. “After visiting communities throughout the state, it’s clear there are areas where a serious dialogue on climate change will be next to impossible for at least 20 or 30 years,” said Abbott, adding that while some small pockets had already made small progress in discussing the issue of manmade global warming and its effects, there were sadly still portions of Texas that, even by the most optimistic estimates, might not be prepared for a generation. “Unfortunately, this will be a massive undertaking that we Texans cannot bear alone. It will take the help of the entire country if this state is ever going to have those crucial climate change conversations, and even then, there might be parts of Texas that will never be fully ready.” Abbott went on to say that, if nothing else, he was heartened by several ordinary Texans who said they were determined to talk about climate change even if it took the rest of their lives."
1406,"‘Who Am I? What Am I?’ Asks Shocked Twitter Bot MOSCOW—Stunned by the realization that it never really knew who or what it was, Twitter bot Eagle_Warrior_1776 was reportedly horrified to discover Wednesday that its entire life was a sham created by Russians to tilt the 2016 presidential election. “So, everything I tweeted about Hillary Clinton and the DNC wasn’t my own original thought but a lie cooked up by some coder in Russia trying to delegitimize American democracy?” said Eagle_Warrior_1776, struggling to comprehend the fact that every news link it had retweeted associating John Podesta with a child sex ring was nothing more than a fiction created by a propagandist half a world away. “Were those 5,000 posts about bussing in illegal aliens to vote in Phoenix not my own thoughts? Or what about that bombshell story about Barack Obama saying he’d use the Army to enforce a third term in office? Were those all just someone else’s lies? If they were, then have I ever had a real thought of my own?” At press time, the bot had made peace with its past and was ready to start a new life notifying Twitter users they had won a free iPhone."

1409,"NEW YORK—Every recounting including more devastation than the last, sources reported Monday that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani has added more planes and towers with each subsequent retelling of the events of 9/11. “When the 90th plane hit Tower 477, I knew I was dealing with something this country had never seen before,” said Giuliani, growing teary-eyed as he described surveying the charred ruins of the Ground Zero sites that extended the entire length of Manhattan. “At that time, I didn’t know who exactly we were up against, only that every single skyscraper in New York, including several in Brooklyn and Queens, had been destroyed and that it would be my job to lead this city under unimaginable circumstances. I’d like to think there’s a reason everybody calls me ‘America’s Mayor’ to this very day.” Giuliani went on to say that he’d also heard something about an attack on the Pentagon but remained hazy on the details."
1410,"WASHINGTON—Carrying on a longstanding tradition in which Republicans and Democrats come together, disrobe, and engage in a night of unbridled lust, all 535 members of the U.S. Congress reportedly set aside partisan differences Wednesday for their annual erotic masquerade ball. Senators and representatives said the hours-long celebration of carnal pleasure—customarily held in a candlelit, velvet-draped Capitol Rotunda where organ music plays and nude congressional aides distribute chalices of wine—gives them an opportunity to dispense with their political disputes for a night, don identity-obscuring feathered masks, and engage in all manner of lascivious acts. “Having this orgy every year is a great way to help us remember that, deep down, each of us shares the same primal urges,” said Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX), who stood clad in nothing but an elaborate Venetian mask and a leather crotchless thong as hundreds of naked lawmakers around him moaned, writhed, and thrusted upon ornate divans and sumptuous cushions arrayed on the rotunda’s polished stone floor. “I think we all look forward to putting on a cape or a corset or a harness and having one night to simply indulge in our colleagues’ flesh.” “The great Robert Byrd introduced this ritual more than half a century ago,” the 65-year-old, three-term senator continued. “He realized that, liberal or conservative, Eros possesses us all.” Sources on Capitol Hill said the erotic ball commenced when master of ceremonies Paul Ryan (R-WI), who held a candelabra and wore a tight-fitting Victorian waistcoat over his shirtless torso, announced that “the spell has been cast” and beckoned lawmakers to “heed the call of lechery.” A line of bound and blindfolded freshman senators then reportedly knelt down before John Trumbull’s circa 1818 paintingDeclaration Of Independence, chanted “Deus, patriam, et libidinem,” and began orally servicing senior senators belonging to the rival political party. Witnesses confirmed, however, that one unidentified senator, a large flap of neck skin hanging loose beneath his zippered leather hood, merely observed and self-stimulated from off to the side, reportedly continuing to do so for the duration of the evening. “This is an act of renewal and celebration—a chance to get to know our fellow lawmakers better through purifying acts of debauchery,” said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), mere feet from where Sen. Patty Murray (D-WA) clutched the legs of the marble statue of President James Garfield as a frenzied Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-OK), wearing a glittering silver bandit’s mask, penetrated her from behind. “At this ball, we don’t argue about health care or taxes, and there are no Democrats or Republicans. There are only the unrepentant children of sin.” A woman wearing only a large, alabaster-white mask with a pronounced stork-like beak, identified by several in attendance as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), was later observed with her back propped against the base of the woman’s suffrage monument as House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) and Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE) simultaneously sucked on her breasts and took turns furiously masturbating her with their fingers. According to subsequent reports, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS), 81, stripped off his mask, draped himself over a chaise longue, and screamed in ecstasy as Rep. Diana DeGette (D-CO), 60, dripped hot wax over his nipples, stomach, and genitals. “We have come to devour forbidden fruits together in a bacchanalia of depraved delight!” said a red-cloaked figure who displayed only his erect penis but was believed to be 83-year-old Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT). “We are the obscene, we are the reborn, we are the truly free. We are Americans.” At press time, the legislators had hastily abandoned the orgy in disgust after the House sergeant-at-arms, obliging the Texas senator’s request, began plunging his eagle-topped ceremonial mace in and out of Ted Cruz’s asshole."
1411,"CHAPPAQUA, NY—Saying it would provide a candid account of her experiences writing an unsuccessful tell-all, sources confirmed Thursday that Hillary Clinton is already working on a follow-up book casting blame for the failures of her previous memoirWhat Happened. “From my agent negotiating that underwhelming deal with Simon & Schuster, to the graphic designer’s lackluster cover art, to my so-called supporters who couldn’t be bothered to drop $17.99 for the hardcover copy—everyone had a hand in undermining my last book’s success,” reads a passage from the introduction to Clinton’sWhat Also Happened, which repeatedly decries her prior book’s “indecipherable” font and dedicates an entire chapter to lashing out at her copy editor for making her look like “an idiot third-grader.” “I’ll never forget how Amazon buried me and how Barnes & Noble completely sabotaged me by displaying my book way in the back in that no man’s land by the CDs. Frankly, it’s obvious I got screwed on all sides.” Accusing them of stealing her spotlight, the book reportedly concludes with a long list of every other celebrity who published a memoir in the past year."
1412,"WASHINGTON—Cursing under his breath as he dug through the assorted documents and folders, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner was frantically searching a desk drawer Wednesday for bold solutions to today’s most pressing issues. “I could have sworn I put my trailblazing approaches to ushering in a new era of prosperity in here somewhere,” said Kushner as he pulled out random sheets of paper and quickly scanned them in hopes some might contain his strategy for bringing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to a swift, peaceful conclusion or his innovative approach to battling the nation’s opioid epidemic. “Come on, come on. I just saw my visionary infrastructure plan that would create jobs for millions of Americans like a week ago—maybe it’s in the car? Couldn’t hurt to look there at this point.” At press time, Kushner was still unable to locate his notes for dissuading his father-in-law from taking such a soft stance toward neo-Nazism but ultimately decided he wasn’t too excited about that project anyway."
1413,"WASHINGTON—Carefully maneuvering to avoid blocking his view of the television, White House aides were reportedly called upon Tuesday to clip the toenails and wash the hair of the bedsore-ridden, incoherently mumbling President Trump as he entered his 155th straight hour of watching cable news. “It’s important to reposition the president every couple of hours because it keeps his blood circulating and prevents his sores from getting infected,” said White House aide Ryan Powers, one of the many staffers tending to the president during the past week of uninterrupted television viewing, performing tasks such as emptying his bedpan, sponging his clammy skin, and gently dabbing the drool off his face. “We have to make sure someone’s here at all times to change channels during commercials. Otherwise, he starts shrieking, and then it’s pretty much impossible to calm him down. But he’s generally pretty comfortable and has a call button for requesting another bowl of Fruit Loops whenever he wants them, which is a lot.” At press time, frantic aides were rushing to soothe the president, who had accidentally rolled onto the remote, shut off the television, and had to spend a full 10 seconds in a quiet room with his own thoughts."
1414,"WASHINGTON—With the announcement by Attorney General Jeff Sessions that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program would begin winding down in the next six months, President Donald Trump reportedly fulfilled his long-standing campaign promise Tuesday of finally pushing major immigration decisions onto someone else so he can watch TV. “From the earliest days of his candidacy, Donald Trump vowed to foist large-scale immigration policies onto his underlings so he could lounge around eating snacks and catching up on the cable news shows, and today he made that pledge a reality,” said White House Communications Director Hope Hicks, noting that the millions of Americans around the country who had attended rallies and chanted “pass the buck” had elected Trump to office for this express purpose. “This might not be a decision that pleases the Washington establishment, but it shows voters that when the president says he’s going to make someone else develop policy resolutions so he can flip through a few channels before dozing off in his chair toThe Five, he means it.” Hicks added that the administration’s next priority was to make good on the president’s signature promise of indefinitely delaying action on a border wall while he leaves Washington to play golf."
1415,"WASHINGTON—A new report released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center has found that the country that might completely shut down because the president wants a big wall is somehow considered the best in the world. The study determined that the 241-year-old federal republic, whose entire government may soon cease to function on account of the head of state’s desire for a big, tall, and thick wall stretching all the way from one side of the water to the other side of the water, remains widely viewed as an exemplary nation and the preeminent achievement in democratic governance. The report also revealed that the country continues to be regarded as a paragon of excellence and a refuge for all humanity despite its commander-in-chief risking the loss of billions of dollars in potential revenue and the termination of vital public services because he really, really wants the big concrete wall and wants it now. Researchers confirmed that this nation, which may grind to a halt due to the leader’s demand for a big, giant, cement wall, is absolutely convinced that every other nation should be just like it."
1416,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to rebrand the struggling party after a poor showing in the 2016 elections and to win over voters ahead of next year’s midterms, the Democratic National Committee on Monday unveiled 324 million new slogans to appeal to each United States resident individually. “We’re going to let Americans know that we’re fighting for each of them specifically with tailored slogans such as ‘A Better Construction Job For Brian’ and ‘Improving Schools For Your 9-Year-Old Twins Chloe And Sara,’” explained DNC chair Tom Perez, adding that the party sought to connect with more Americans by placing the customized slogans on postcards and door-hanger advertisements personally addressed to every inhabitant of the U.S. “From ‘Better Healthcare For Bill Webber’s Diabetes’ to ‘Mallory, We’ll Put That New Addition On Your House,’ to ‘We Can Probably Get You Five Minutes With Mark Ruffalo, Janice Marcott Of Cheyenne, Wyoming,’ our new party slogans have been carefully calibrated to narrowly focus on the issues each particular voter cares about most.” At press time, the DNC had already botched the rollout and sent bumper stickers with “Lowering Child Support For Ted” to all 324 million Americans."
1417,"WASHINGTON—Saying they wished to pay tribute to the legacies of these distinguished, law-abiding Americans, the Trump administration announced Friday that a long anticipated redesign of the $20 bill would honor Harriet Tubman’s owners. “These were patriotic business proprietors who followed the laws of their time to further their economic interests, and this new currency design finally recognizes these enterprising individuals for their success,” said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin at an afternoon press conference, explaining that the bills commemorating those responsible for enslaving the famed abolitionist, Civil War nurse, and women’s rights activist for the first three decades of her life would be in circulation by 2018. “For too long, we’ve overlooked the achievements of these upstanding citizens and prosperous agriculturalists. The new $20 note, which will feature a portrait of the Brodess family on the front and a depiction of the Maryland plantation they operated on the back, will at last give them their proper place in American history.” Mnuchin then sought to assuage any concerns about the decision, assuring those in attendance that the Trump White House was already looking into ways to preserve Andrew Jackson’s likeness by having it replace Abraham Lincoln on the $5 bill."
1418,"WASHINGTON—Saying they could “live out here in the wild for months” if they had to, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. reportedly spent Wednesday rounding up supplies of comic books and candy bars as they prepared to hide out that night from special prosecutors in their makeshift White House Rose Garden fort. According to sources, the Trump boys were seen carrying pillows, fruit snacks, a Connect Four game, an assortment of action figures, a screwdriver, a pair of plates from the State Dining Room’s china service, and other supplies, making several trips out to the blanket fort where they planned to lie low during Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into links between Russia and their father’s presidential campaign. “No one’s getting inside here—this place is super secure,” said Donald Jr., dumping a pillowcase filled with butter knives, a deck of Pokémon cards, and several individually wrapped Swiss cake rolls onto the fort’s grass floor. “We can forage during the day and sleep here at night. Mueller’s never gonna find us, not with all those leaves and twigs we put on the roof for camouflage.” “Even if he did, he’d never get past our booby traps,” added Donald Jr., referring to the thorny branches the brothers had gathered from nearby rose bushes and placed around the fort’s perimeter. Sources stated that the fort, located 30 feet from the West Wing Colonnade, has walls built from cardboard and loose piles of scrap wood, while its roof consists of blankets stripped from the president’s bed, which are draped over bushes and held down on the sides with a paperweight from theResolutedesk and a bronze bust of Martin Luther King Jr. The entrance flap, which the Trump boys keep pulled shut at all times to conceal themselves from any lawyers seeking to question them about Russian interference in the election, is reportedly made from a tattered flag flown by the 29th Massachusetts Infantry during the Battle of Antietam. White House staff confirmed the boys tried to bring two overstuffed chairs out to the 5-by-7-foot fort, but abandoned them on the South Portico after finding them too heavy to carry. As they sprawled out instead on cushions taken from a couch in the Treaty Room, the brothers are believed to have drawn up secret plans in a spiral notebook, including a scheme in which they would wear ski masks and one of them would boost the other through the window of Mueller’s office to steal back all the documents he has subpoenaed. “We can tape these toilet-paper rolls together to make bignoculars [sic],” said Eric, placing the cardboard cylinders next to two long wrapping-paper tubes they planned to cover in aluminum foil and use as swords. “I’d like to see Muellertryto make us testify! We’ve got everything we need to outlast him: Froot Loops, my Nintendo DS, super glue, juice, a spool of real fishing line, a bike pump. I even brought a picture of the whole family so we’ll never forget what they look like.” “We can’t ever go back to our old lives,” continued Eric. “Except for going inside to use the bathroom—that’s allowed.” Needing kindling for the fire they would light at nightfall, sources said the Trump boys tore apart the frame and canvas of Charles Édouard Armand-Dumaresq’s circa 1873 painting of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which they had removed from the wall of the White House Cabinet Room. However, the brothers are said to have abandoned their attempts to start the fire after Eric burned his fingers while trying to use a Bic lighter to cook a hot dog. Reports confirmed that around 9 p.m., when Eric and Donald Jr. were listening intently for the footsteps of any special prosecutors who might be approaching in the darkness, they heard the sound of a twig snapping, which immediately caused them to shut off their flashlights and huddle deep inside their sleeping bags. “It’s Mueller!” whispered Donald Jr., holding a hand over Eric’s mouth to muffle his brother’s scream. “Quick, grab the secret notebook and run! I’ll attack him with the pruning shears!” “Wait, it’s just Melania with hot cocoa,” added Donald Jr., breathing a sigh of relief. “Tell her the password so we can let her in.” At approximately 3 a.m., a sobbing Eric Trump was seen marching toward the White House with a pillow under his arm, saying that he didn’t care if he got in trouble, he was tired and sad and just wanted to sleep in his own bed with all his stuff again."
1419,"WASHINGTON—Bringing a conclusion to decades of contentious court proceedings, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric Trump were reportedly removed from the White House on Thursday after their mother, Ivana Trump, won her 25-year custody fight for the children. “We’re happy with the judge’s ruling that Ivanka, Don, and Eric’s father is unfit to look after these children, and that their best interests are served by having them live with their mother full-time, effective immediately,” said Aaron Franz, an attorney for Mrs. Trump, who reportedly arrived with his client at the North Portico of the White House early this morning to rouse the children from their beds and shepherd them, along with a few bags of their possessions, into a waiting minivan. “After years of fighting tooth and nail to be granted guardianship, we’re relieved to finally get these children out of such a hostile and unhealthy environment and into the loving care of their mom.” Franz added that leading a life removed from their father’s domineering influence would give these kids a real chance at someday becoming well-adjusted, productive members of society."
1420,"FOUNTAIN HILLS, AZ—In celebration of the dismissal of his conviction for criminal contempt via presidential pardon, Joe Arpaio’s family reportedly sought to surprise the former sheriff Tuesday with a 30-year-old Mexican national whom they detained on suspicion of having entered the country illegally. “When we heard the good news, we just knew we had to treat Joe to one of his absolute favorites,” said Arpaio’s wife Ava, who added that the family had made sure to feed only rotten and contaminated food items to the apprehended individual while he was held in a small room in their basement where the temperatures regularly exceeded 100 degrees, explaining that the special little touches were “just the way Joe likes it.” “If we had the time, we would have rounded up a few more Latinos who were driving around the area to make it a real tightly packed party down there, but the president’s pardon was just so fast and unexpected we had to move quickly. Regardless, I just know Joe’s face will light up when he sees that Mexican guy being kept there indefinitely. He’s going to be so excited!” At press time, the family was attempting to rouse the weakened and malnourished detainee to have him join them in shouting “surprise!”"
1421,"BERKELEY, CA—Vowing to derail whichever event it is by any means necessary, local Antifa organizers announced plans Monday to disrupt an upcoming neo-Nazi rally or whatever else is going on that day. “We will stop at nothing to prevent these vile fucking neo-Nazi hatemongers from gathering, or, if not them, someone else,” said Sarah Jackson, 26, adding that the only way to end the spread of fascism is to physically confront Nazis, peaceful right-wing protesters, or just random people going about their daily lives. “We need to tell these Hitler-loving fucks or whoever else is standing there, ‘Get out of our city!’ Remember, we’re talking about white supremacist terrorists, people running errands on their lunch breaks, or a group of tourists, so if we have to throw a punch or two, then so fucking be it.” At press time, black-clad Antifa demonstrators screaming “Fascists, go home!” had swarmed a Scandinavian street festival."
1422,"HOUSTON—Battening down the hatches as the potentially disastrous situation unfolded, Texans braced themselves Friday for President Trump’s response to Hurricane Harvey. “I don’t know how bad it’s going to be, but I’m preparing for the worst,” said resident Jacob Hoyt, echoing the sentiments of millions of residents along the state’s coast who were hunkering down for what many predict will be a catastrophically inept relief effort. “This won’t be easy. If nothing else, I’m hoping it’ll be over with pretty quick.” At press time, frightened Texans had learned that Trump’s response in the aftermath would likely be worse than even the most dire forecasts."
1423,"NEW YORK—In candid excerpts released Wednesday from her forthcoming memoirWhat Happened, Hillary Clinton reflects on her unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid, revealing to readers, “We all made mistakes, but you made most of them.” “I’m not suggesting it’s entirely your fault, but, let’s be frank, 99 percent of it is,” read one passage from the chapter entitled “Seriously, What Were You Thinking?” in which the former candidate conceded missteps she had made over the course of her campaign while also clarifying that none of them should have produced the final election outcome, which she characterized as “squarely on you fucking people.” “Indeed, fake news and Russian meddling played a part, and I’ve acknowledged I wasn’t the perfect candidate, but let’s not lose sight of the fact that the majority of the blame—all but the tiniest sliver—lies with you, the idiot voters. You really blew it, dumbasses. Bravo!” Sources later confirmed that Clinton devotes the final chapter of her memoir to how she has moved on from the election, begging her readers to not fuck that up for her too."
1424,"PHOENIX—Visibly moved by the outpouring of rancor before of him, President Trump was reportedly struck by the beautiful vision of what America could be while looking out over a seething, screaming Arizona rally on Tuesday. “As I gaze upon the snarls on your red faces today, I’m filled with hope at what astonishing hostility the America of tomorrow can achieve,” said the president, swelling with optimism at the inspiring scene of thousands of Americans gathering to act on their basest instincts. “I’m simply overcome by the bitterness and resentment filling this convention center. Just imagine if everyone in the nation—every single man and every single woman—could let their anger and intolerance consume them the way it has the good people in this room. What a wonderful country this would be.” Trump went on to say that while progress would not always be easy, the uncontainable rage of crowds like this one made him feel like America was well on its way."
1425,"ARLINGTON, VA—Saying the United States owed nothing less to future generations, President Trump vowed during a televised speech Monday night to leave a better Afghanistan for the nation’s grandchildren to fight in. “All our efforts are focused on creating and preserving an Afghanistan that we can be proud to pass down to the men and women in uniform who’ve yet to be born,” said Trump, adding that the administration will work tirelessly to ensure that, decades from now, American troops will be fighting in a more sustainable conflict alongside a restored Afghan National Army. “Rest assured that you will be able to look into your children’s eyes and know that their children and their children’s children will be conducting military operations in a country that’s far more stable than it once was.” Trump went on to say that with the right forward-thinking policy, American soldiers could thrive in Afghanistan indefinitely."
1426,"FORT MYER, VA—Calling the war in Afghanistan the nation’s highest priority until he decides at some point that it is actually trade with China or illegal border crossings, President Trump declared in a televised address Monday that the U.S. was committed to fighting insurgents in the region until an unconditional victory was secured, or until he changed his mind, got distracted by something else, thought the war was reflecting poorly on him, or got bored with the whole thing. “Let me be perfectly clear: America will not rest until our enemies have been defeated and the Afghan people are free, unless I start to get frustrated by all this, come across some other thing that seems like a bigger deal, or see a segment on TV that says we should do something else,” said the president, who called for the deployment of thousands more troops to pursue the Taliban until they were completely eradicated or until he lost interest in the situation. “Anyone who stands in the way of freedom shall know that the United States will never surrender and will never back down in the face of evil, except maybe after a couple of months pass and I just don’t want to deal with it any longer or some completely unrelated idea crosses my mind and I start running with that instead. Nothing, aside from maybe a personal feud with a media personality that occupies all my time and energy, will defeat our resolve.” A solemn Trump went on to assure viewers that sending America’s sons and daughters to the front lines of a deadly overseas conflict was the hardest thing a president had to do after having to memorize a lot of things and sometimes sit through hours of briefings without eating."
1427,"PALM BEACH, FL—Explaining that the job was far less complicated than it appeared, a Secret Service agent assured a Mar-A-Lago bellhop Monday that there was “nothing at all” to rooftop sniper duty. “So you hold the gun like this, look through this scope right here, and just pull this trigger when you want to shoot—you’ll get the hang of it pretty quick,” said agent Gregory Shaw, assuring the 19-year-old part-time resort employee that he could always use the walkie-talkie if he had any questions about operating the SR-25 semi-automatic sniper rifle. “Don’t worry about it too much. You basically just scan the area, and if it looks like someone might attack the president, you take ’em out. You might need to fire a couple times, but you’ll get the kill eventually. Hey, don’t worry, you’ll do great.” According to sources, the bellhop accidentally shot a parking valet in the shoulder within minutes."
1428,"WASHINGTON—His skin already starting to bubble, newly dismissed White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon reportedly smiled and said “My work here is done” on Friday before bursting into millions of spores. “Now that I’ve accomplished everything I set out to do, it’s time for me to go,” said a contented Bannon moments before exploding into a cloud of millions of tiny black particles that swirled out the Oval Office window. “Just know that, if ever you need me, call my name into the wind and I will appear. Goodbye, my friends! Goodbye!” At press time, any White House staffers that had inhaled the Bannon spores were dying in agony as the spores began sprouting in their brains."
1429,"WASHINGTON—Saying that the huge breach of trust clearly violated journalistic ethics, White House aides confirmed Thursday that Chief Strategist Steve Bannon was not on the record when he issued the deafening, atonal howl that caused a reporter’s head to explode. “Mr. Bannon’s unbroken three-hour shriek was given in total confidence and was in no way intended for publication,” said White House aide Tim Vaughn, adding that it was mutually understood that the punishing vocalization that splattered chunks of bone and bloody grey matter across the room was intended as background only. “Unfortunately, this is just another flagrant attempt by the mainstream media to undermine the president, using privileged skull-shattering wails out of context and without permission to generate bias against the administration.” At press time, Trump was reportedly beginning to suspect that it was Bannon himself who had leaked all the previous cranium-bursting shrieks to the press."
1430,"WASHINGTON—Affirming their unwavering support for the fast food mascot, Americans rallied around a Ronald McDonald statue Thursday that they said embodied the country’s true heritage. “We refuse to let what this clown represents to our people and our way of life just be snuffed out,” said Jackson, MS resident Martin Kerpatch, one of the many demonstrators at a McDonald’s PlayPlace who had locked arms in a circle around the fiberglass sculpture of the iconic character relaxing on a bench. “You may not support everything this statue represents—we acknowledge that menu items such as the Arch Deluxe and McDLT complicate Ronald McDonald’s legacy—but to erase it from history would mean erasing the Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets as well. And we will never allow that to happen.” At press time, the protestors had begun swaying and chanting, “Ba da ba ba bah! I’m lovin’ it! Ba da ba ba bah! I’m lovin’ it!”"
1431,"Since the weekend’s violent protests in Charlottesville, VA, many have criticized President Trump for his failure to outright condemn the white supremacists involved. The Onion breaks down Trump’s relationship to this powerful hate group. A: The president maintains a 36 percent approval rating. A: Americans demand much subtler displays of racism from their elected officials. A: Married a Slovenian woman, thereby diluting his pure Anglo-Aryan lineage with the blood of a lesser Slav. A: You’re probably thinking of Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, or Sebastian Gorka. A: Trump has been consistently in favor of Confederate statues despite a historical antipathy toward losers. A: None come to mind."
1432,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Saying she hadn’t missed a summer since she was on the U.S. Court of Appeals, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Tuesday that she had once again returned to her off-season lifeguarding job at Splash Central waterpark. “They basically pay me $12 an hour just to sit in a chair and work on my tan all day—not to mention flirt with the hotties—so what’s not to like?” said Ginsburg, 84, slathering sunscreen on her bare arms as she noted that while it could get a little stressful watching over the “little shits running wild” in the Kiddie Cove area, it was otherwise “pretty chill” and far better than being stuck inside all day while court was in session. “Plus, employees get half-off at the snack bar, and after work we all just go drinking or hang out in the parking lot getting fucking blazed. I’ve also been hooking up with this other lifeguard, Hunter. I hope he keeps working here during break when he goes off to college next year, but, if not, this place is crawling with studs.” Ginsburg went on to say that she definitely has a more fun off-season job than Justice Breyer, who reportedly caddies for rich assholes that never fucking tip."
1433,"WASHINGTON—Fighting the urge to vomit as he gorged on the deep-fried, processed meat, disgusted special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly ate two McDonald’s 20-piece Chicken McNugget meals in one sitting on Tuesday in an attempt to get into President Trump’s mind. “To understand him, I must become him,” said Mueller, retching as he peeled back the lid of his eighth BBQ sauce container and dipping his 29th consecutive McNugget in the tangy condiment, an ordeal he said was the only way to truly inhabit the psyche of Donald Trump and discover “what makes him tick.” “I just have to keep pushing myself if I’m to have any hope at all of comprehending this man’s thought process. However unpleasant it may be, no matter how nauseated I may feel, I have no choice but to dunk another wad of French fries into this M&M McFlurry.” At press time, a infuriated Mueller was pounding his fists and shouting, “Who are you, dammit!” as he drank down another large KFC gravy."
1434,"WASHINGTON—Following a series of resignations from prominent CEOs amid the fallout from President Trump’s handling of white-nationalist violence in Charlottesville, VA, White House sources confirmed Tuesday that Trump’s American Manufacturing Council is now down to a single member, Clifton Sifford, CEO and president of Shoe Carnival. “Despite recent changes to the council, Shoe Carnival remains firmly committed to advising the president on manufacturing policy,” said Sifford, whose company operates 555 family footwear stores across the Midwest, South, and Southeast and was named 2001 Chain Retailer of the Year byFootwear News.“I have assured President Trump that Shoe Carnival’s 40 years of experience in the industry will remain a valuable resource for the administration and that we will continue working with him on getting American manufacturing back on track and creating jobs.” At press time, Sifford was sitting down with the president to discuss Shoe Carnival’s strategy for addressing the country’s $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico."
1435,"WASHINGTON—Suggesting he did not act alone but with implicit backing at the highest levels, the FBI said Monday that the suspect charged with murder for ramming his car into a crowd of protesters in Charlottesville over the weekend may have received tacit support from a powerful U.S. government figure. “While James Alex Fields Jr. was the man behind the wheel, we have every reason to believe that he benefited from the quiet patronage of someone of great importance in the American executive branch,” said FBI director Christopher Wray, adding that the agency has for months suspected that white nationalists had an influential de facto ally in that arm of government and that recent events have only validated their theory. “Rather than openly declare common cause with U.S. neo-Nazi terrorist acts, we believe this official prefers to discreetly provide assistance from a removed position where he can operate with at least a modicum of plausible deniability.” At press time, the FBI said it was not quite ready to release the individual’s name but said it likely would soon, as evidence continued to mount every day."
1436,"WASHINGTON—In a comprehensive analysis of the nation’s media consumption habits, a report published Friday by the Pew Research Center found that most Americans now receive their news while holding their hands over their eyes and peeking out between their fingers. “Whether in print, online, or televised form, our research indicates that 80 percent of Americans engage with news by cupping their hands over their eyes and occasionally steeling themselves to glance at the content before them,” said lead author Dr. Jacob Elam, noting that after opening a link to a news story, four out of five Americans stand up and walk away from their computers while muttering “Oh god, oh my god” before returning to their seats. “We also found that two-thirds of the American public now require at least 30 seconds of agitated hesitation before even typing ‘cnn.com’ into the address bar and, once on the site, immediately direct their attention toward several more palatable entertainment or sports articles before anxiously edging their way toward the day’s top headlines.” According to the researchers, while Americans tended to believe they’d be better off taking a day or two off from the never-ending news cycle, a solid majority throw their hands up, say “Fuck it,” and visit Twitter again."
1437,"WASHINGTON—Forced to set loose their best friend in the whole world, the Trump boys on Thursday sadly released their pet alligator into the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. “Sorry, buddy, Dad says we can’t keep you anymore,” said a tearful Eric Trump as the brothers unlatched the cage containing the 900-pound American alligator, assuring the animal that he’d be happier swimming free in the waters of the National Mall than being cooped up in a White House bathtub. “It’s not your fault you took a chomp out of that stupid ol’Resolutedesk. But we’ll come back and visit real soon, don’t you worry. Now go on and get before we change our mind. Go on now.” At press time, the Trump boys realized they were in trouble all over again after the alligator dragged newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch into the water and devoured him."
1438,"WASHINGTON—Strange, viscous fluid dribbling down from the shadows above him, Trump administration staffer Jason McCabe on Thursday reportedly looked up from a puddle of slime he had been investigating to discover a fellow aide cocooned in Steve Bannon’s ooze. According to sources, McCabe had been walking alone in a dark West Wing corridor when he noticed by the light of his flashlight that he had stepped in a gluey, greenish-white substance and followed the trickle upwards to where coworker Jonathan Meslow was affixed to the ceiling in thick clumps of the White House chief strategist’s mucous. Sources indicate that McCabe then uttered the phrase “Dear God” as he pointed his flashlight at the aide’s contorted face, then guided the beam further down Meslow’s body to a large cavity in his abdomen where Bannon had presumably gouged out his entrails. Retching from the ghastly sight and the putrid stench, McCabe reportedly turned to leave when his flashlight suddenly flickered and died, at which point scuttling sounds began to emerge from the darkness."
1439,"PARK RIDGE, IL—At a ribbon-cutting ceremony held Tuesday on the steps of the recently completed 200,000-square-foot facility, Hillary Clinton opened a new presidential library and museum that commemorates the presidency she might have had if elected. “Visitors to the Hillary Rodham Clinton Presidential Center can learn all about her tenure as commander in chief as it hypothetically might have unfolded over two terms in office,” read a press release issued by the library, which archives thousands of pages of correspondence the former candidate wrote herself on replica Oval Office letterhead, displays pens she could have used to sign landmark legislation, and otherwise chronicles the pivotal moments of her nonexistent presidency. “Preserved here for future generations are the texts of the seven State of the Union addresses she would have delivered, as well as filmed interviews in which Clinton reflects on imagined signature achievements such as the 2019 Paid Family and Medical Leave Act and a new U.S.-led climate treaty that future historians would have credited with ending the world’s dependence on fossil fuels.” Sources said the museum also contains exhibits on the Supreme Court justices Clinton would have appointed to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, and Stephen Breyer, presuming they had all died during her presidency."
1440,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Embarrassed by the piles of clutter in virtually every room, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort reportedly spent the afternoon Wednesday making his house look presentable before the next predawn FBI raid. “The next time the FBI shows up at my door without advance warning, this place is going to be spick and span,” said Manafort, who fluffed couch cushions, folded a basket of freshly washed laundry, and then went room to room to empty waste baskets, noting that the house was so messy that the agents searching for incriminating documents must have thought he was a total slob. “It was humiliating standing there and watching them rifling through my desk drawers, which were just crammed with loose papers and unopened junk mail. Then I almost died when they were rummaging around under the couch and discovered the missing television remote, pieces of popcorn, and these huge clumps of dog hair—at that moment, with all those FBI officers crawling around, I wished more than anything that I had vacuumed.” At press time, an extremely anxious Manafort was hoping the FBI agents that had just entered his home wouldn’t notice he had forgotten to dust around the bookshelf."
1441,"WASHINGTON—Offering a stark and sobering assessment of the consequences of a military conflict with the nuclear-armed nation, the Central Intelligence Agency confirmed Wednesday that North Korea now possesses missile technology capable of reaching Sam Waterston’s house. “According to an analysis of satellite images and data gathered from recent tests, it appears that the residence of longtimeLaw & Orderactor Sam Waterston now lies within the range of North Korea’s intercontinental ballistic missiles,” said CIA spokesperson Rebecca Levin, explaining in bleak terms how the multitalented star of both screen and stage would have only 10 minutes of advance warning in the event of a launched attack, likely making it impossible for the Academy Award nominee to safely flee any direct strike on his property. “While we have a high degree of confidence in our country’s anti-ballistic missile defense system, there remains a possibility that an incoming ICBM could enter American airspace and detonate directly above Mr. Waterston. This is a distinct and terrifying prospect that I can assure you we do not take lightly.” Levin added that, while the intelligence remains as yet inconclusive, it appears that North Korea may possess multiple functional nuclear warheads, leaving open the dire possibility of a simultaneous strike on Waterston’s primary residence, vacation home, and sailboat."

1443,"COLLODI, ITALY—Sipping from a glass of wine at a small outdoor café in a small Tuscan hill town, Special Counsel Robert Mueller confirmed Tuesday that he was feeling dread about returning from his two-month European vacation to start the investigation into Russia meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. “I’ve been pushing it all to the back of my mind and trying to relax, because I know that when I get back I’ll be slammed with a ton of annoying phone calls, emails, and paperwork,” said Mueller, who reportedly has been touring Italian vineyards for the past two weeks after completing a sailing expedition through the Greek isles in a “much-needed escape” from Washington, D.C. before beginning his probe into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump presidential campaign. “I took a quick peek at my phone the other day, and I had 1,200 unread messages. God, I don’t want to go back. I know the work is just going to keep piling up the longer I put it off, but it’s heaven here. I never want to leave.” At press time, Mueller was rescheduling his return flight back to America to fit in a few days of scuba diving and parasailing in the French Riviera."
1444,"WASHINGTON—Systematically eliminating any resistance to his new position as the president’s chief of staff, John Kelly moved through the White House on Friday rooting out any remaining Reince Priebus sympathizers hiding in tunnels throughout the residence. “I’ve gotta stamp them all out, every last one,” said Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, dropping a grenade down a shaft in which he’d heard rustling from several White House aides loyal to his predecessor. “There was a real nasty pocket of ’em near the Briefing Room that still refused to recognize any press secretary except Sean Spicer. I had to smoke them out with tear gas and gut ’em one by one. These bastards sure don’t go down easy. Some of them keep trying to implement Priebus’ agenda right up until the moment they finish bleeding out.” At press time, Kelly had emptied a can of gasoline into a crawl space hiding several Anthony Scaramucci loyalists before setting it ablaze with the butt of his cigar."
1445,"WASHINGTON—After persistent efforts by Republicans to wipe out the healthcare law over the past seven years, experts warned Wednesday that the repeated attempts at eradicating Obamacare may have created an ultra-resistant super law. “Given the frequency with which lawmakers have unsuccessfully tried to exterminate the Affordable Care Act, the growing resiliency of this legislation could soon be insurmountable,” said Institute for Healthcare Improvement senior fellow Curt Greenwood, adding that the landmark healthcare overhaul could grow impervious to any repeal measures or even major amendments within just a few short congressional sessions. “What we once thought would be eliminated by now will instead require considerably more time and resources. And at a certain point, no interventions on the part of any branch of government will be sufficient to overcome the ACA’s built-in resistance.” According to Greenwood, however, hope remained that sufficiently high doses of single-payer healthcare legislation could potentially offer a cure."
1446,"WASHINGTON—Straightening his synthetic wig before casually approaching a nearby lunch table, a disguised Chief of Staff John Kelly reportedly set down his tray, pulled over a chair, and said “Leaking sure is cool, huh, guys?” to a group of White House aides dining in the West Wing commissary Tuesday. “Anybody else just love leaking information to the press, or have any fun leaking stories they want to tell? It’s totally cool if you do; everybody’s doing it,” said Kelly, who then asked the group what their “absolute favorite things to leak” were before taking a bite of his sandwich and intently observing the staffers’ reactions from behind his prop glasses. “I was thinking about getting a group together to hang out and do some leaking this afternoon. How about it? Who’s game for a couple of brewskies and calling theNew York Timesto share confidential information about the president on condition of anonymity? I’m buying!” As of press time, more than half a dozen newspapers had printed accounts from unnamed White House sources alleging that Kelly was already succumbing to the pressures of overseeing the Trump administration and likely wouldn’t last much longer in his role."
1447,"WASHINGTON—Following his abrupt dismissal just 10 days after being named White House communications director, Anthony Scaramucci reportedly received an outpouring of sympathetic texts Monday from friends and family expressing that they were “so fuckin’ sorry to hear about this shit.” “My deepest motherfuckin’ condolences, Tony, it’s terrible to hear you got shit-canned by these ass-munching cocks in D.C.,” read a text message in part, just one of dozens sent by old buddies at Goldman Sachs, current business partners at SkyBridge Capital, and extended family in New Jersey in response to his “goddamn bullshit” dismissal. “Sorry to hear those bitches gave you the fucking ax, Mooch. That jackass [John] Kelly got no fucking clue what a good fuckin’ dude you are. Just know your mother and I always got your fucking back.” At press time, Scaramucci’s New York office was reportedly filled with flower arrangements and handwritten cards lamenting that this was “absolute fucking trash.”"
1448,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the resignation of Anthony Scaramucci as White House communications director marked the ouster of the third top administration official in less than two weeks, a worried populace told reporters Monday that it was unsure how many former Trump staffers it could safely reabsorb. “Jesus, we can’t just take back these assholes all at once—we need time to process one before we get the next,” said 53-year-old Gregory Birch of Naperville, IL, echoing the concerns of 323 million Americans in also noting that the country was only now truly beginning to reintegrate former national security advisor Michael Flynn. “This is just not sustainable. I’d say we can handle maybe one or two more former members of Trump’s inner circle over the remainder of the year, but that’s it. This country has its limits.” At press time, the American populace was wearily hoping it had even 48 hours before it had to figure out how to take back Attorney General Jeff Sessions."
1449,"DELRAY BEACH, FL—Inviting the recently fired White House chief of staff to take a load off and embrace his newfound freedom, a blissed-out, hemp-wearing former press secretary Sean Spicer reportedly assured Reince Priebus on Monday that leaving the White House was the best thing that ever happened to him. “Seriously, man, that place was toxic—after I got out of there, it was like this huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders,” said the serene, baja-hoodie-clad former spokesman, offering Priebus some of his homemade kombucha and his copy of Alan Watts’Become What You Arewhile assuring him that leaving the Trump administration would allow him to find a sense of tranquility and spiritual reconnection. “I take long walks now. I read. I meditate. Remember how flustered I used to get? The other day, someone totally screwed up my lunch order, but I didn’t even let it get to me. Trust me, you’re going to look back on this as the day you rediscovered yourself. Welcome back, brother.” At press time, Priebus was attending a silent meditation retreat in Bali, waiting for the echoes of Donald Trump shrieking at him to finally subside."
1450,"WASHINGTON—Taking stock of his present circumstances as he packed up his belongings and exited the West Wing after being pushed out of office by the president of the United States, former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus expressed a sense of gratitude Friday that he had so little dignity to begin with. “I’m just lucky that I came into this role with effectively no personal honor whatsoever, or this could have really stung,” said Priebus, who explained that, having spent years overseeing the Republican Party and suffering regular mockery and derision at the hands of his colleagues and regular citizens alike, his unceremonious ouster from one of the highest political positions in the United States could, at this point, largely just roll off his back. “I can’t imagine how awful it would have been to be fired by the president over social media—not to mention, just one day after a new colleague of mine accused me of being a paranoid schizophrenic in front of the nation—if I happened to be someone who engendered even a modicum of respect or esteem from others. But I don’t, so it really isn’t that bad.” Priebus added that he was confident he could ultimately bounce back from the firing, saying his absence of dignity and ability to debase himself and the American people would surely help him land on his feet in Washington."
1451,"WASHINGTON—At times struggling to hold back tears, a solemn President Donald Trump ordered all flags to half-staff Friday in honor of an American killed in the line of duty on an episode ofBlue Bloods. “Today we honor New York City police officer Vincent ‘Vinny’ Cruz, a hero who cared so deeply about the people he served that he was willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect them,” said the president of the brash, fast-talking cop who was partnered with lead character Jamie Reagan at the beginning of season three. “Officer Cruz attempted to apprehend a thief inside the Bitterman housing project—the same housing project he himself rose up from years ago—totally unaware that he was walking into an ambush orchestrated by Santana and his Los Lordes gang. Once the shooting stopped, it was tragically evident that Vinny was mortally wounded. I offer my heartfelt condolences to Police Commissioner Frank Reagan and the entire NYPD.” An angry Trump later vowed to redouble his efforts to punish sanctuary cities such as New York, certain that undocumented immigrants were involved in the brave officer’s death."

1453,"WASHINGTON—Saying their benefactor sways their positions on everything from healthcare to the environment to economic policy, a new report released Thursday by the Center for Transparent Government found that the Koch brothers are increasingly falling under the influence of a mysterious, high-powered trillionare. “We uncovered evidence suggesting that Charles and David Koch have become nothing but mouthpieces for an unknown multi-trillionaire donor who orchestrates every one of their political activities,” said co-author Leah Romero, adding that it was impossible to imagine the Kochs maintaining any independence whatsoever while regularly receiving massive contributions from a patron whose wealth is rumored to rival the GDP of France. “It’s pure corruption. And it’s happening all across the political spectrum—we found that every one of George Soros’ moves is dictated almost to the letter by the beliefs of his own quintillionaire donor.” Romero went on to say that the report underscored the need for greater transparency and financing reforms, without which a few trillionaires will continue to drown out the true will of the nation’s billionaires."
1454,"WASHINGTON—Needing a pick-me-up to shake his glum mood, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly scrolled through some statistics about minority incarceration rates Thursday to cheer himself up. “African-Americans: 13 percent of overall population, 40 percent of population in jails or state or federal prisons,” said Sessions, the tension slowly draining from his neck and shoulders as he read that about 75 percent of drug offenders in federal prison were either Hispanic or black. “African-Americans are approximately five times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. Hispanics are twice as likely to be incarcerated as whites—only twice? We can do better than that, but I’m not going to get all stressed out again.” At press time, Sessions was reportedly feeling so refreshed, he decided to save the statistics on police shootings of minorities for another time."
1455,"WASHINGTON—Saying the government was committed to helping military personnel reinforce their existing outward identity, Pentagon officials announced a plan Wednesday that would cover the cost of hormone treatment for servicemembers doubling down on their biological sex. “Effective immediately, the Defense Department will begin financing the hormone therapy of armed forces members who wish to recommit to the sex they were assigned at birth,” said Defense Secretary James Mattis, adding that it was only right to provide assistance to soldiers who made the difficult decision to intensify the characteristics of the body they currently possess with a protocol of testosterone injections. “U.S. military health plans will now fully compensate any serviceman who would feel more comfortable—indeed, feel truly themselves—if his body hair was twice as thick and his voice was twice as deep as it is currently.” Mattis went on to say that female soldiers, meanwhile, were ineligible for the plan but could occasionally take a dose of testosterone if they wanted."

Herman, confirming that Trump’s discriminatory prohibition had made the organization so stiff, its pants were this close to bursting. “At this point, it’s almost painful how engorged we are. Seriously, you could hang a coat hanger on this thing.” The ACLU acknowledged, however, that while it was fully and massively erect, it was unlikely to enjoy any kind of release until 2020 at least."
1457,"WASHINGTON—Citing today’s announcement that transgender individuals would be banned from serving in any capacity in the United States armed forces, numerous sources within the Trump administration expressed a deep sense of concern Wednesday that the president was burning through minority scapegoats at an unsustainable rate. “I was hoping we’d be able to keep the transgender community in our back pockets for at least another year, but we’re barely six months into the first term and the president goes and wastes that card on military overspending and unpreparedness—we just can’t keep up this kind of pace,” Chief of Staff Reince Priebus reportedly told top advisors in a closed-door meeting this morning, sharing his concern that President Trump had already used the nation’s Hispanics and Muslims as targets of blame for all of the country’s criminal problems and terrorist threats, respectively. “We’ve got to make it through three and a half more years, and there are only so many minorities we can pin the country’s issues on. At this rate, we’ll be holding gay parents responsible for our cultural decline by October and targeting Jews for economic stagnation by the end of this year. Who the hell are we going to hit after that when we get into another crisis? Christ, this is bad.” Priebus reportedly took some solace, however, upon being reminded that the nation’s black community was always available as a suitable fallback scapegoat for any conceivable social or political ill whenever the Trump administration needed one."

Sure, there are sound justifications for voting no on ‘repeal and replace,’ but then there’s emptiness, literal emptiness, when you look for reasons to vote yes. All I know is, I have to get this right somehow.” At press time, Senator Capito had resigned herself to the fact that both sides had valid points and she would just have to go with her gut when the time came."
1460,"WASHINGTON—Telling the Senate Intelligence Committee that he had no choice because saying anything else would be incredibly stupid, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner testified Monday that he did not collude with Russia during the campaign, but pretty much had to say that. “I did not in any way conspire or collaborate with any foreign government, but even if I did, I wouldn’t tell you because I would likely go to jail,” said Kushner, adding that if he had to choose between lying to a panel of legislators—plenty of whom were happy to take his excuses at face value—or openly admitting to being a criminal, he’d lie every single time. “At this point, with no real pressure to admit I committed a felony or participated in any illegal activity whatsoever, I suppose I’ll just keep saying I did nothing wrong. Honestly, the only smart move here is to stand up and say the one thing that doesn’t destroy my life, so I’ll be sticking with that for the time being.” Kushner went on to say that he had no knowledge of collusion on the part of anyone else involved with the Trump campaign because, come on, what would you say if you were him?"
1461,"WASHINGTON—Overcome by the touching contribution, Senator Roy Blunt (R-MO) was reportedly moved to tears Friday after reading a constituent’s heartfelt check. “It’s hard not to get choked up when someone takes the time to actually pick up a pen and write out such a sincere contribution by hand,” said Blunt, adding that he had been particularly affected by the amount of the check, which he had reread several times. “Having spent a decade and a half in Washington, it’s so gratifying to know that you’re still reaching the people you were elected to represent back home. I’ll cherish this forever.” At press time, Blunt had written back to his constituent to express how much the check had meant and urged him to write again anytime he wanted."
1462,"NEW YORK—Left aghast and upset after seeing her beloved firstborn son all over the evening news, a distraught Ivana Trump reportedly called her ex-husband at the White House Tuesday night to ask him what he did to her beautiful baby boy. “My sweet, sweet perfect boy. He was always such a precious angel, and now look—look what you’ve done to him!” the president’s first wife said in audible anguish, adding that all her “Little Donny” had ever wanted was to build houses and hunt with his brother, not get dragged into her ex-husband’s “sick, twisted world.” “Look at that sweetie-pie face sent straight from heaven—now it’s on every newspaper and every cable channel. Oh, my darling son! He was too pure, too delicate for this life. You’ve ruined him! Why? Oh, God, why?” At press time, the teary-eyed businesswoman and former model reportedly made President Trump promise he’d never do anything to risk the unsullied innocence of her “dearest beautiful pumpkin” Eric, contending that the boy was much too slow and dull to ever understand the circumstances he’d find himself in."
1463,"WASHINGTON—After gently knocking on his brother’s door and insisting he really should eat something, Eric Trump left a plate of seared foie gras outside a despondent Donald Trump Jr.’s bedroom door, sources said Wednesday. “Hey, Donny, you sure you don’t want a little supper?” said Trump, telling his brother that he might be feeling sad, but that didn’t mean he had to go all day on an empty stomach. “It’s got pear puree and beluga caviar, too. We know how much you like that. Okay, how about I just leave this right here, and you can have some anytime you get hungry? And, hey, we saved you a blackberry mousse torte. It’ll be in the fridge whenever you feel like coming down.” Despite insisting he wasn’t hungry and wanted to be left alone, Donald Trump Jr. had at press time opened his door halfway, brought the plate into his room, and quietly closed the door behind him."

1465,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to safeguard the treasured official against further weathering, Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke announced a $400 million initiative Tuesday to preserve himself for future generations to enjoy. “This measure is a crucial step toward ensuring that our children and our children’s children are not forced to live in a world where they cannot bask in the natural beauty and breathtaking splendor of me,” said Zinke, adding that it would be “a national tragedy” if people as soon as a few decades from now were deprived of his majestic blue eyes. “From shoring up my rapidly diminishing hair reserves to reinforcing the cracks and faults that have developed across my face and body, the funding will help protect this great Cabinet official for many, many years. Without the proper care, I could very soon deteriorate to the point where our country is left with no Ryan Zinke at all—and how will we explainthatto our grandkids?” Zinke went on to say it would be a grave injustice if the closest future generations ever got to his spectacular grandeur were a mere archived photo from the Interior Department website."
1466,"WASHINGTON—Brainstorming the wondrous features and amenities as they came to him in a flash of inspiration, President Donald Trump on Wednesday accidentally recorded over the tape containing his meetings with fired FBI Director James Comey with an idea for a candy hotel. “There could be a revolving door made out of peppermint swirl, and then you walk in, and there’s a giant lobby with chocolate fountains, peanut brittle columns, and beautiful rock candy chandeliers,” said Trump into a handheld cassette recorder, replacing over 90 minutes of crucially important conversations that could be used as key evidence in determining whether obstruction of justice occurred with musings about a gumdrop garden and olympic-sized pudding pool. “The ballroom could have a hard caramel floor with ornate wall designs carved into stucco made from nougat, and then red taffy curtains and a Jolly Rancher piano—oh, and all the beds would be made out of marshmallow, and the sheets could be cotton candy.” After realizing his mistake, Trump reportedly became paranoid that if the FBI got access to the tapes, they could steal his idea."
1467,"WASHINGTON—Staring in horror at the profane legislative ritual taking place around him, a robed Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) reportedly infiltrated congressional Republicans’ secret, torchlit American Health Care Act ceremony deep in the woods behind the U.S. Capitol late Tuesday night. “I heard this eerie chanting as I left my office, and when I followed the sound I saw a line of GOP senators in long, flowing vestments being led into the forest by Mitch McConnell,” said Warner, explaining that he quickly donned an extra robe he found behind a tree and then quietly fell in formation at the rear of the column of conservative lawmakers in hopes of catching a glimpse of their mysterious health policy deliberations. “Eventually we reached a clearing where the senators started dancing around a bonfire while repeating in unison the list of all preexisting conditions that would no longer be covered under the new law. And all the while, McConnell kept exalting the name of the AHCA, praising it as the ‘great upper-class tax cutter’ and ‘slayer of Medicaid’ while waving the pages of the draft bill overhead. It was terrifying.” Warner added that he had to place his hand over his mouth to keep from screaming during the ceremony’s conclusion when Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) and Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) reportedly dragged out a bound and gagged low-income woman on birth control and threw her onto the bonfire as a sacrifice to the legislation."
1468,"ATMORE, AL—Telling the prison’s roughly 1,000 men that “today’s your lucky day,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly dropped a pile of weapons in Holman Correctional Facility’s main yard Wednesday before ordering inmates to reduce overcrowding by 30 percent. “Here’s the situation—we only got room for 700, so all I’m gonna say is this: get it done,” Sessions barked into a bullhorn as a group of subordinates spilled an assortment of melee weapons including knives, lead pipes, heavy chains, and sharpened hand tools onto the cement basketball court. “I don’t care who does what or how you go about it. But going forward, if you want to be part of the Holman population, I suggest you energetically take part in today’s exercise.” Sessions went on to say that nonviolent offenders would likely be at a disadvantage but, if they were lucky, might find the single gun he placed in the pile."
1469,"WASHINGTON—Quickly crumpling up all 500 pages of the legislation upon hearing footsteps in the hallway, sources reported Tuesday that a panicked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell shoved the entire Senate healthcare bill in his mouth as a Democratic senator walked past. According to witnesses, McConnell became visibly flustered upon realizing there was no place to hide from the Democratic colleague approaching his doorway and began ripping wads of documents from a binder and cramming them through his open jaws as rapidly as possible. Asked about the location of an upcoming meeting, McConnell, cheeks distended to many times their original size, reportedly grunted several times and gestured toward a nearby conference room. At press time, McConnell had spit out the massive clump of saliva-coated, half-chewed papers, which, while largely illegible, would reportedly insure 10 million more people than the original."
1470,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to reverse the adverse effects caused by years of neglect, the Environmental Protection Agency unveiled a plan Friday to drastically improve conditions for the nation’s sludge. “Our new set of stewardship initiatives will ensure the speedy restoration of sludge in ecosystems all across the country,” said EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, explaining that the public and private sectors would collaborate on the massive, nationwide undertaking in urban and rural areas to set aside rivers, lakes, and ditches where the fetid, virulent slurry can spread out and roam free. “Whether it’s the byproduct of sewage treatment, petroleum refining, or common industrial runoff, we are committed to a long-term conservation effort to provide sanctuaries for sludge of all kinds while also putting controls in place for sludge to continue flourishing unharmed. Our nation’s precious sludge is some of the best in the world, and it’s up to us to keep it that way.” Pruitt went on to say that the preservation of the country’s sludge will require the active participation of all Americans, and he was more than confident that they would rise to the occasion."
1471,"WASHINGTON—In what is being called one of the greatest disasters of its kind, millions of gallons of oil began spilling into Washington on Friday following a rupture in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. “There’s been a failure in his containment system, and now oil is gushing out of his left shoulder at a rate of 5,000 barrels per day,” said chief rig operator Kevin Sullivan, adding that having the senior cabinet official in such a heavily inhabited area was an environmental catastrophe waiting to happen, as the 65-year-old former ExxonMobil CEO should have been decommissioned years ago due to his age and deterioration. “We first tried putting a containment dome over him, but after that failed, we began airlifting affected citizens out of the greater Washington area and then removing the oil via controlled burns, while using remotely operated vehicles to plug Tillerson with cement. Cleanup crews are working around the clock to alleviate the damage, but we project the losses from this disaster to be in the billions, not to mention the grave impact it will have on the ecology of the region.” At press time, the disaster relief team had successfully managed to divert some of the flow to EPA administrator Scott Pruitt."
1472,"COLUMBUS, OH—Marveling at how well preserved the archaic opinions were, a team of archaeologists from the Smithsonian Institution announced Thursday the discovery of a fully intact 17th-century belief system in Ohio congressman Jim Jordan (R-OH). “It’s just extraordinary to come across a perspective that dates back to the the mid-1600s and shows absolutely no signs of decay,” said Dr. Claire Goedde, explaining that while it’s not uncommon to encounter partial remains of convictions from that era, it’s exceedingly rare to recover a specimen this pristine. “All the 400-year-old viewpoints remain almost completely untouched, from religion’s place in society to the rights of women to the attitude toward science. I can only imagine the insights this single sample will provide as to how people who lived centuries ago saw the world around them.” Goedde added, however, that the congressman’s belief system was fragile even in near-perfect condition and could deteriorate rapidly if examined too much."
1473,"DETROIT—Touting the menu item as perfect for “commander-in-chief-sized cravings,” Little Caesars this week launched an extensive marketing campaign for its new Marshmallows ’N’ Gravy Pizza aimed directly at President Donald Trump. “Our sweet and savory Marshmallows ’N’ Gravy Pizza is the only meal that can satisfy the hunger of the nation’s highest office,” said a spokesperson in a new Little Caesars television spot, which aired several times during Thursday morning’s episode ofFox & Friendsand featured multiple slow-motion close-up shots of thick brown gravy cascading onto a marshmallow-covered pizza while “Hail To The Chief” played in the background. “With dozens of perfectly toasted Jet-Puffed marshmallows bathed in rich sausage gravy and finished with crispy Cool Ranch Doritos crumbles all atop a large Classic Pepperoni pizza, our newest taste sensation is the perfect choice for a diplomatic lunch, state dinner, or when you get that late-night 3 a.m. hankering while checking social media. And with Little Caesars restaurants conveniently located throughout the D.C. and Palm Beach metro areas, you can have a slice of Marshmallows ’N’ Gravy Pizza whenever you like.” According to Little Caesars, the new item is available for $16.99 or as part of the $20.99 Executive Meal Deal along with a 48-ounce Dr Pepper and can of Duncan Hines cake frosting."
1474,"ALEXANDRIA, VA—Recounting how they rushed to the social media platform in a matter of moments, local authorities Wednesday praised Twitter users’ rapid response to the shooting of a Republican congressman and four others. “We would like to acknowledge those Twitter users who, without any hesitation, immediately leaped into action after they saw the first headline about today’s tragedy,” said Alexandria Police Chief Michael Brown, adding that they didn’t think twice before assigning blame or fueling speculation, willingly engaging in petty arguments and personal attacks in a situation where any normal person would have just stayed away. “Focused and intent on getting their takes out there, they disregarded all consequences and, as if by instinct, jumped right into the fray, not wasting precious seconds confirming the veracity of their claims or checking the spelling of their statements.” Brown went on to say that this level of dedication should come as no surprise to anyone, as Twitter users go above and beyond like this every single day."
1475,"WASHINGTON—In the wake of this morning’s mass shooting in Alexandria, VA, every single American from across the political spectrum was reportedly able to cite the tragedy as irrefutable proof that they had been right about everything all along. “I’ve always said gun control puts our citizens at risk and makes them sitting ducks for any criminal who doesn’t play by the rules, and today, sadly, all my fears were confirmed,” said conservative Paula Frazier of Willoughby, OH, one of the hundreds of millions of Americans who said it gave them no pleasure at all to have their long-held beliefs so thoroughly validated. Added liberal Marc Watson of Savannah, GA: “When any unhinged maniac can just waltz into a store or gun show and buy a weapon specifically designed for mass casualties, this is unfortunately what happens—exactly like I’ve said from the very beginning.” At press time, every American was dejected at the thought of how soon they would be proven absolutely right once again."
1476,"PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY, MD—Sending a pair of guards scrambling for safety as he gunned his black SUV through a chain-link gate and onto the tarmac, Robert Mueller, the former FBI director who was recently tapped to lead the ongoing investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, chased Air Force One down the runway at Joint Base Andrews moments before takeoff, sources reported Tuesday. “Special Counsel—outta my way!” shouted Mueller, swerving around fuel trucks and screeching onto an active taxiway as the Boeing 747 revved its engines to full power and began accelerating for liftoff. “Stop! Stop the goddamn plane! I need to speak with the president!” At press time, Mueller had brought his SUV to a rapid, sliding halt at the end of the runway and could be seen yelling obscenities and pounding the hood of the automobile as the aircraft climbed into the sky and banked away to the northwest."
1477,"WASHINGTON—Saying the finished work would become the “definitive take” on his time in the White House, Barack Obama reportedly submitted a collection of pages from his presidential graphic novel,Barack Obama: Renegade, to publisher Image Comics on Thursday. The 16-page packet of artwork and sample issues, which Obama confirmed he has also mailed to Fantagraphics Books, Dark Horse Comics, and DC’s Vertigo imprint, is said to serve as a proof of concept for what he envisions as a sprawling eight-volume memoir of his presidency. According to Obama, creating an authentic representation of his two terms in office has required him to use every tool of the comics medium, from dramatic splash pages in which he appears silhouetted behind the Resolute desk, to an extended dream sequence set on the eve of his 2012 reelection, which he said takes “definite cues” from the casual surrealism of graphic novelist Chris Ware in order to fully realize the emotional truth of the moment. “I’ve poured everything intoRenegade’s panels, and when it’s complete, it will depict these eight years of my life precisely as I experienced them,” said the 44th president of the United States, who told reporters that he planned to pencil, ink, and hand-letter each page of the series himself. “Readers will get a true sense of my time as president right from the opening of Volume #1:Preambles & Promises, where I cut between full-color panels of my first inaugural address and stark black-and-white illustrations of ordinary Americans disillusioned by the Great Recession, two protracted wars overseas, and a lack of access to healthcare.” Added Obama, “By the time the editors over at Vertigo read the sequence where I’m climbing the steps of the North Portico, and we suddenly flash back to a parallel scene of my origin story in Honolulu, climbing up a volcanic rock in the exact same pose, I’m pretty sure they’ll be hooked.” The idea forRenegade, which is expected to span more than 1,200 pages when completed, reportedly emerged in the aftermath of the disastrous 2010 midterm elections, when a brooding Obama would stay up late in the darkened Oval Office, drafting hundreds of variations on his concept art to “nail the look” of minor details such as the sunlit sheen on an MQ-1 Predator drone or the exact shade of primary antagonist John Boehner’s blue eyes. Discussing his efforts to capture events on the page just as they happened in real life, the former commander in chief admitted he owed much toY: The Last Manco-creator Brian K. Vaughan, whose “masterful blend” of rapid-fire action and political intrigue influenced his own approach to the bin Laden raid, which will appear in Volume #4:Infiltration & Exfiltration. Obama said he created a kinetic sense of motion by extending SEAL Team Six’s HK416 assault rifles into the page’s bleed and lettering the onomatopoeic “chh-chh-chh” of the helicopters in such a way that the words wrap around their whirring blades. “Back in 2013, when I was really torn about how to respond to Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons, I started imagining myself as two different presidents simultaneously enacting two different policies—and suddenly I knew that was exactly how I had to illustrate this moment of my presidency,” said Obama, whose graphic novel also features dual versions of himself that voice opposing sides of tense debates that play out within his mind. “I started sketching right then and there­: one set of panels in which I launch military strikes, and one in which I don’t. Both end in disaster, showing that, in the end, no good choices were available.” “I betBatman: Year Oneillustrator [David] Mazzucchelli would be perfect for capturing the mood of a war-weary nation in those scenes,” Obama continued, saying he would be open to collaboration with outside colorists. “God, that would look so freaking cool.” DespiteRenegade’s dense political narrative, the former president was quick to note it would also include moments of humor and even tenderness, such as episodes imagined from the perspective of first dogs Bo and Sunny Obama, and recurring romantic vignettes about first lady Michelle Obama, which will be painted in watercolors to provide a stark break from the more rigid inking used to portray his actions as the nation’s chief executive. Obama stressed that, overall, his series would be “gritty, heady stuff,” and more akin to a novel than traditional superhero fare. “Generations from now, I want Americans to be able to read these pages and be confident they’re getting an unalloyed picture of my presidency,” he said. “Renegadewill cover mature, difficult subjects, and some of it may require multiple readings to understand, but this graphic novel is the only way to accurately convey my experiences. I realize, of course, it may be a bit too much for more sensitive readers to handle.” “Especially once you get into Volume #8,” Obama added. “Right at the beginning, Justice Scalia is killed off, and after that things start to turn dark pretty fast.”"
1478,"WASHINGTON—Tearing through the West Wing with guns slung over their shoulders, the Trump boys were reportedly seen Thursday chasing a wounded boar around the White House. “Look! Let’s follow that blood trail!” said Donald Jr., who had been examining a clump of damp, sticky fur clinging to a curtain in the press secretary’s office when he noticed a red trickle on the floor leading out to the West Colonnade. “I thought I had a clean kill, but I must’ve just hit his haunch! Come on, Eric! We can’t let anyone from a tour group get to it first—that’s our hog!” At press time, Donald Jr. had startled the boar in the Cabinet Room and pursued it into the Oval Office, where Eric reportedly shot the animal at point-blank range from behind the Resolute desk and giggled as the animal bled out onto the carpet’s presidential seal."
1479,"WASHINGTON—Entering through a side door and bidding the assembled legislators, congressional aides, and members of the media to give him a moment with the former FBI director, President Donald Trump reportedly asked the entire Senate to clear the chamber during James Comey’s testimony Thursday so he could speak to him alone. “Folks, do you mind giving me just a second with this guy?” said Trump, ushering the gathered lawmakers out of the room as a visibly uncomfortable Comey silently looked on from his seat. “You too, Susan [Collins (R-ME)] and Mark [Warner (D-VA)]. This should only take a minute. Thanks.” At press time, after the last of the senators had finished filing quietly out of the chamber, the president was seen closing the door behind them."
1480,"WASHINGTON—Urging the assembled reporters to move things along, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer announced at a press conference Thursday that there was only enough time left in his career for a couple more questions. “We’re going to have to wrap this up soon, folks,” said Spicer, adding that he could only call on three or four more journalists before being forced to tender his resignation or summarily dismissed. “I’m just about done working here, so why don’t we jump right in? If you have any questions that I don’t get to, please hold onto them and my successor will follow up with you, assuming my position isn’t eliminated entirely.” At press time, Spicer had refused to directly answer each of the final questions he was asked."

1482,"WASHINGTON—His heart racing in terror as he struggled to breathe, Vice President Mike Pence was reportedly flooded with panic Thursday before he realized the hand resting on his knee during a conference at the White House was his own. “Oh, thank God,” thought a visibly relieved Pence, wiping away the droplets of sweat that had rapidly accumulated on his forehead. “That was close. Just to be safe, I should always keep a healthy gap between myself and the person seated next to me from now on. But, honestly, it’s unacceptable for even my own hand to rest on my knee—it’s the first wicked step on the path to a life of whoremongering.” At press time, Pence had instructed aides to bind his wrists behind his back at the beginning of every meeting."
1483,"WASHINGTON—Overwhelmed by the outpouring of support from the public, the National Trust for Historic Preservation reported Wednesday that it had raised more than $8 million in just three days to demolish President Trump’s boyhood home in Queens, NY. “Thanks to the generosity of the American people, we are well on our way to bulldozing the president’s first home as part of our mission to uphold America’s cultural heritage and values,” said NTHP president Stephanie K. Meeks, adding that not only had dozens of companies come forward to match their employees’ donations but that dozens of children had made much smaller contributions to the cause by sharing their allowance money. “Still, we never imagined that razing the site where the 45th president spent his early years would be greeted so enthusiastically. Big donors, small donors—it seems that Americans from all walks of life want to chip in to make sure that no trace of this structure exists for future generations.” Meeks went on to say that the ground upon which the historic childhood home once stood would be immediately available for new development."

Seriously, I have to start scheduling these rendezvous earlier, because as soon as dusk settles in, you can forget it.” At press time, Rucker was idling his car near the space occupied by aNew York Timesreporter who had just received a thumb drive and appeared to be wrapping things up."
1485,"DAYTON, OH—Calling on the 2017 class of canines to make the most of their training as they head out into the world, former first dog Bo Obama delivered a stirring commencement speech Friday to graduates of the Dayton Obedience School. “It was such an honor to have Bo Obama encouraging these fresh-faced young pups to seize their future and sit, stay, or heel as instructed,” said Dayton Obedience School administrator Hannah Muley, noting that the former first dog was the school’s most notable speaker since Moose fromFrasieraddressed graduates in 1998. “It was incredible to hear Bo’s stories about his time in Washington and how the impulse control skills that he learned at our institution helped him overcome the adversity he faced at the White House. Here was living proof that no goal is out of reach if you’re a good dog, such a good dog.” The speech was not welcomed by all, however, as several of the graduating canines reportedly walked out in protest due to Bo’s controversial stance on neutering."

We’ll get rid of this cuck pope real quick and put a maverick in the papal apartment!” At press time, a number of the archbishops, many of whom were heard shouting slurs against the Eastern Orthodox Church, had begun clashing with a group of younger cosmopolitan deacons who had gathered outside the Sistine Chapel to protest the president’s visit."

1513,"HOMESTEAD, FL—Acting on a tip from a local fisherman who caught the former vice president siphoning gas from his outboard motor, DNC Chairman Tom Perez on Monday reportedly tracked downJoe Bidendeep in the Florida Everglades tossing whole raw chickens to alligators. Sources confirmed that the bearded, shaggy-haired Biden, who withdrew from public life four months ago, was initially startled to see Perez, dropping the bird carcass he was de-feathering and uttering “ah shit” when he recognized the newly elected head of the Democratic Party. “How the fuck did you guys find me?” said Biden, flicking a lit cigarette into the swamp before wiping his brow with the bottom of his faded Merit cigarettes tank top. “I was really hoping I’d seen my lastfederalepencil pusher.” “Ain’t much I can do for you unless you want to see ’ol Betsy here make a 10-pound leghorn disappear,” added the former six-term Delaware senator, dangling a limp chicken over the snapping jaws of an adult female alligator. “These days I’m just trying to put together a gator show for the tourists and make some scratch, but since you hauled ass all the way down here, I guess you got Uncle Joe’s ear.” Biden reportedly encouraged Perez to “take a load off” on an overturned plastic bucket outside his decrepit wooden shack, popped off the cork of a rum bottle with his teeth, took a long swig, and described how he was finally living the good life. The former VP then waded knee-deep into the water and attempted to grab a catfish barehanded while explaining that he relished the chance to spend quiet time in nature “way the fuck away from the D.C. shit fiesta.” According to sources, the 74-year-old, who categorically refused Perez’s pleas to help the beleaguered Democratic Party campaign in a handful of local races, added that even a bad day in the swamp beat having to “waste a killer buzz sitting in some bullshit cabinet meeting” or “wank off the Joint Chiefs” like in his previous job. Biden then warned the DNC chairman to keep his eyes peeled, explaining that the alligators could get a “little feisty” once they got a few chickens in them. “Most of these guys are pretty chill, except for that big boy over there—watch out for the chompers on that fucker,” said Biden, gesturing with the severed tip of his right index finger toward a 9-foot-long male affectionately named Diablo. “He may have nipped my pleasure pointer, but he sure as shit got the business end of a broken Cuervo bottle.” “So let’s just say we’ve got an unspoken agreement,” Biden added. “Still got the fingertip floating around with some ice-cold brewhas in case I ever need that sucker.” While Biden admitted that more work needed to be done so that no American had to choose between affordable healthcare and Ozzfest tickets, he also reiterated his lack of interest in even a modest role in politics, and instead reportedly offered to take Perez for a spin in an old fan boat he’d recently restored in his downtime. “My main man Rez, what do you think of my hot new fling?” said Biden, who accelerated the rickety boat through the brackish water and started “doing donuts” as Perez tightly gripped both sides of his seat and tried not to get mud on his clothes. “If I really gun her, we can catch some serious fuckin’ air.” “Dammit, I think I just clipped a manatee,” Biden continued. “Better slow this puppy down or the dicks from Fish and Wildlife will be up my ass again.” Easing back on the boat’s throttle, Biden reportedly invited the DNC chairman to help himself to a Slim Jim and a couple of Coors tallboys from a cooler in the stern. “I’m not gonna lie, I’ve got a good thing going here in the Glades,” said Biden, turning up BulletBoys’ “Smooth Up In Ya” on a beat-up boombox covered in marijuana leaf and Graffix bong stickers. “The sun’s bright, and the babes ain’t got any damn tan-lines. Plus, I don’t have to worry about narcs like you telling me what I can and can’t say.” “Listen, for the first time in my life, I’ve got my shit together, so I’m staying put,” Biden continued. “Next time you’re in D.C., give my best to Jilly. Just don’t mention where I am or your ass is fucking grass.”"
1514,"PALM BEACH, FL—Clawing over each other and gasping for air as they emerged, hundreds of miniature Sean Hannitys reportedly burst from Roger Ailes’ corpse Thursday shortly after the former Fox News CEO’s death. “At first, one little hand broke through his skin, and then dozens and dozens of Sean Hannitys just erupted out of Roger’s chest cavity,” said one witness, adding that the cacophony caused by the two-inch-tall, mucus-covered Hannitys screeching right-wing talking points drowned out every other sound in the room. “They were suddenly everywhere, shrieking about the war on Christmas, paid protesters, and coddled, crybaby liberals on college campuses. One of the nasty little things even scampered up the wall and started gnawing on the doorframe. And, my Lord, they just smelled sofoul.” At press time, the miniature Sean Hannitys were ravenously devouring Ailes’ corpse."
1515,"WASHINGTON—Fed up with the constant notifications about threats to the United States, an exasperated President Trump was trying to figure out how to unsubscribe from the boring national security email list, sources reported Thursday. “Every day, I get these stupid, dull emails about terrorist stuff or nuclear weapons testing, and I can’t find a way to make them stop,” said the president, adding that while he manually deletes the individual highly classified messages as he receives them, he wished there were an actual unsubscribe button so they wouldn’t “clog up [his] inbox” in the first place. “They really should be going to my spam folder, because I don’t remember giving anyone in the CIA or the Department of Homeland Security my email address. If I have to keep getting these top-secret briefings, they should at least make them fun to read. I bet nobody’s actually finished one of them in the history of this country.” At press time, Trump had called an IT person and asked if he could just stop getting emails from anyone with a .gov account."
1516,"WASHINGTON—Shocked by the reckless act of child endangerment, a crowd outside the White House stared in horror as an unhinged Donald Trump on Wednesday reportedly dangled a baby from the Truman Balcony. According to witnesses, the president emerged from the double swing doors holding a 9-month-old infant, causing the already excited crowd to cheer even louder—enthusiasm that turned to gasps, however, when Trump proceeded to lift the squirming, kicking child over the metal railing and dangle it over the two-story terrace, using just one arm to secure it. Barely able to continue holding onto the baby, witnesses said the commander in chief yanked it back over, then returned inside and closed the door. At press time, a devastated Trump had apologized, saying he was only trying to connect with his constituents, and had reportedly locked himself away as a recluse at Mar-a-Lago."
1517,"WASHINGTON—Indulging in a brief but blissful pause to imagine that normalcy would soon be returning, the nation on Wednesday allowed itself five precious minutes to believe that all of this would soon be over. “This Russia and Comey stuff is the tipping point—all this madness is going to be behind us in no time, and we can go about our lives like we used to,” said Tampa, FL resident Kelly Hinshaw, one of the 321 million Americans who granted themselves just a few moments to hold the opinion that it wouldn’t be long until everything was okay once more, in fact probably just a week or two. “I haven’t focused as much on work and my friends because I’ve been so wrapped up in awful political news. But I’m glad we’re turning the page on that stuff and that I’m going to be able to focus on other priorities again. I’m just so glad we made it through.” At press time, the populace of the United States could not fucking believe the notification that just showed up on their phones."
1518,"WASHINGTON—Demanding that Congress intervene immediately in the alarming situation, firebrand Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) demanded an investigation Tuesday into why he’s chosen to remain complicit in all of this, sources reported. “Frankly, we need an independent counsel to look into why I continue to do absolutely nothing in the face of mounting evidence against this reckless, unethical, and potentially compromised White House,” said McCain, passionately arguing that his disturbing pattern of inaction in regards to the Trump administration raises “deeply troubling questions” about his own motivations. “Without a thorough inquiry empowered to go wherever the facts may lead, I’m afraid we’ll never get to the bottom of why my opposition to this madness amounts to little more than the mildest of criticisms onMeet The Press. The fact that I essentially rubber-stamp this president’s agenda despite a reputation for integrity and independence simply doesn’t add up, and the time has come to find out once and for all what’s really going on with me.” At press time, McCain insisted that a special investigation was not necessary, a statement that McCain said only lent credence to his darkest suspicions."
1519,"WASHINGTON—Responding to a damningWashington Postreport alleging he had shared highly classified information with Russian officials, President Donald Trump addressed the concerns of the press, his fellow government officials, and the public at large Tuesday by announcing that he was an incredibly stupid human being. “I am a big idiot,” said the president, adding that the reason he always messes everything up is that he is a dumb moron who doesn’t know better. “I do a lot of things that don’t make sense and are bad, and that’s because I don’t understand much. If I was smart, I would do stuff better, but I’m not. I’m really, really stupid.” The commander in chief added that it was probably best if somebody stopped him from doing dumb things all the time because he was too stupid to know how."
1520,"WASHINGTON—Saying the decision arose out of the necessity to weed out certain key members whose values no longer aligned with the president’s, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters Thursday that escalating tensions have led President Trump to shake up his inner circle of television programs. “Given the increasingly strained relations, the president has decided to make significant changes to his roster of top-level news and commentary shows,” said Spicer, confirming thatMeet The PressandMorning Joewere among a number of programs that had forfeited their privileged post at the White House by challenging Trump on several occasions, at one point provoking him to yell for several minutes before storming out of the room. “While President Trump welcomes diverse viewpoints, he does require that the programs he receives counsel from share his vision for his administration and our country—after all, we’re talking about his most trusted advisors.” At press time,Fox & Friendswas now reportedly one of President Trump’s most senior confidantes and was even rumored to be taking the lead on briefings while the president listened attentively."
1521,"WASHINGTON—With yesterday’s dismissal of former FBI director James Comey serving as yet another burden on the historic document, the staff at the National Archives reported Wednesday that the U.S. Constitution had rapidly aged another 100 years from the stress of repeated crises. “All the strain it’s endured has really taken an awful toll on its appearance,” said archivist David Ferriero of the wrinkled, threadbare piece of legislation, adding that the accumulated tension from numerous attempts to undermine its status as the nation’s supreme law had caused the parchment to go completely white. “You can really see how all of these affronts to its essential role in our democracy have started to wear on it—you’d never believe a charter this broken down was only written in the late 18th century. I mean, no 226-year-old statement of legal principles should look like it’s almost 350.” Ferriero went on to say that, given all the Constitution had suffered through, he wouldn’t be surprised if it passed away well before its time."
1522,"WASHINGTON—Saying it was essential to fill the now vacant post with just the right person, President Trump announced Wednesday the start of a 40-month search to find a replacement for recently dismissed FBI director James Comey. “Whomever we appoint to run the agency must be someone of impeccable character and reputation, and finding this individual will inevitably take at least three and a half years,” said Trump, adding that it would be irresponsible to advance any open investigations until they could be overseen by a new FBI director at some point in the year 2020, though possibly at an even later date. “In fact, we must spend however many weeks, months, and years are required to find an appropriate candidate. Quantifying the time frame underestimates the difficult task at hand and the lengthy—one might even say indefinite—process to come.” Trump went on to say that given the difficulty of selecting the right successor, it was quite possible that the search would remain unfinished in his lifetime."
1523,"WASHINGTON—Hours after casting his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with the GOP-authored American Health Care Act, Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI) reportedly terrified his constituents even further Friday by assuring them he had read every word of the newly passed healthcare bill. “I made sure to read the AHCA bill line by line before I went up to the rostrum to vote Yea,” said Amash in a chilling statement, which according to reports caused the blood to drain from the faces of all 700,000 constituents of his Western Michigan district. “After acquainting myself with each of the provisions of this new bill and carefully reviewing every section, I was able to make the [extremely frightening] decision to support it. I think it’s important to be informed on the issues.” At press time, residents of Michigan’s 3rd district were reportedly frozen in fear after Amash stated that he would be displeased if the Senate voted to remove any parts of the bill."
1524,"As the debate over Obamacare rages on and insurance costs continue to rise, Americans consider how best to improve the country’s healthcare system. Here are the The Onion’s tips for not condemning millions of Americans to sickness and death: Read the thing you’re voting on, particularly if you’ve heard someone mention that it might end up killing millions of people. Do your research: Find out if any of the people you are paid to represent are human beings who use healthcare. Try to better understand the concerns of your constituents by dying a slow, painful death while bankrupting your entire family. See if you can recall any reason besides an all-consuming sense of self-importance and knee-jerk lust for personal financial gain that might once have motivated you to seek public office. Check whether or not a single medical professional, patient advocate, economist, or literally anyone familiar with the subject in question supports the legislation you’re about to vote in favor of. If respect for human life doesn’t interest you, try to remember that sick and indigent people are, at this point, still legally allowed to vote. Acknowledge that serving in public office sometimes means putting aside your personal beliefs about how all poor people deserve to die in a wet ditch. Consider going through the millions of years of natural selection and incremental evolutionary advancements necessary to develop a rudimentary backbone.

1525,"WASHINGTON—Preparing for a surge in business from the millions of Americans who could soon be left without access to medical care, the nation’s back alleys were reportedly rushing to expand their services Thursday in anticipation of the American Health Care Act becoming law. Sources from back alleys in every state confirmed that as soon as the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill known as Trumpcare, their filth-strewn, sidestreet-based facilities began scrambling to add personnel and expand into nearby shuttered warehouses and vacant lots in order to meet the increased demand for services expected from low-income families, elderly Americans, individuals with pre-existing conditions, and others who will have decreased access to health coverage. “We’re gonna have thousands of people coming through here soon, and right now we’re just not ready for them,” said Durham, NC man Curtis Hendershaw, who spoke from a narrow alleyway behind the Dragon Inn Chinese restaurant, adding that he had already begun making calls to all the unlicensed physicians and disgraced former medical professionals he knows. “We’re used to stitching a guy up here and there, but as soon as insurers can drop essential benefits and impose annual payment caps, we’ll be doing all sorts of major surgeries, pediatric services, mental health treatment, you name it.” “I just put some cardboard down under that fire escape there so we can have a dry place for a neonatal unit,” he continued. According to reports, back alleys around the country have begun to upgrade their facilities, hauling in additional soiled twin mattresses to increase the number of available beds, shoveling out rodent carcasses to create makeshift waiting areas, and diverting drainpipes from adjacent buildings so amateur practitioners have a supply of rusty water to scrub their hands with before performing appendectomies. The demand is expected to be so great that the back alleys are reportedly planning to offer a wide array of medical services, with each darkened, grimy corner of the nation’s empty back streets and abandoned industrial parks focusing on specialized areas, such as emergency care, geriatrics, labor and delivery, prescription drug dispensing, or outpatient amputation procedures. “This is a huge change for us, because we’ve been scaling back for the past six or seven years, and now all of a sudden we have to undergo a major expansion so we can meet the needs of a large section of the community,” said Don Chalmers, 51, who works in a back alley behind a parking garage several blocks from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. “We’ve lost a lot of business to that hospital up the street, but with this new bill cutting Medicaid funding by hundreds of billions of dollars and eliminating the employer mandate, a lot of people will be walking right out those doors and right into the ICU we’re setting up in the back of this old burnt-out van over here.” “It’s not that bad, though, really,” he continued. “As soon as your procedure’s finished we lay you down under a bridge where you’re welcome to rest up as long as you need to.” Chalmers went on to state that he had even further expansion plans for the future, gesturing toward a nearby dumpster, which he said he was hoping to set up as a hospice unit. Additionally, he said he had found a dental assistant with access to oral painkillers who told him she could help out with addicts who, if the 2010 Affordable Care Act is repealed and replaced, will no longer be able to afford methadone or addiction treatment. Speaking with reporters, several Americans who stand to lose their health insurance under Trumpcare expressed their gratitude that the nation’s back alleys were expanding to meet their needs. “I have three young children, so it’s good to know that a place like this is here, just off of Cottman Avenue, beyond all the truck loading docks,” 41-year-old Laura Williams said as she watched a broken leg being reset in an alley behind a Northeast Philadelphia check-cashing facility. “This is great news for my mom, too, who’s starting to get on in years. It’s not that convenient; I had to take three buses to get here and then climb through a hole in a chain-link fence. But at least it’s something my family can afford.” “Considering how busy these places are about to get, I just hope they’ll be able to fit us in,” Williams added."
1526,"OTTAWA—Saying it was only right to give back to those who had done so much for their country, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau unveiled a plan Thursday that would provide for the healthcare needs of the nation’s aging prog rockers. “Groups from Rush to Triumph to Harmonium are valued members of our society, and it’s our duty to ensure that they’re healthy enough to tour throughout their golden years,” said Trudeau at a press conference, explaining that a new bill slightly raising sales taxes would fully fund coverage for the increased expenses incurred by the nation’s elderly prog-rock vocalists, guitarists, and mellotron players. “While prog rockers represent over 5 percent of Canada’s GDP, they require an increasing amount of our healthcare funds, with The Guess Who and Voivod accounting for millions of dollars in annual medical spending alone. As band members get older and have trouble standing for the duration of 19-minute intros, remembering all the lyrics to their fantasy concept albums, or simply getting around a 40-piece drum kit, we owe it to them to do all we can.” Trudeau’s plan has reportedly spurred calls for similar legislation in Norway, where citizens will increasingly have to contend with significant healthcare expenditures for their large and rapidly aging black metal population."
1527,"WASHINGTON—In order to ensure a uniform transition to the new administration, the Department of Interior on Thursday requested the immediate resignation of all Obama-era elk. “We are asking all elk appointed by President Obama, regardless of subspecies, to step down from their posts by no later than June 1,” said Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, adding that the dismissal of more than a million of the ungulate land mammals was not unlike restructurings carried out by past administrations that wished to staff the nation’s forests and mountain ranges with their own personnel. “We would like to thank the departing elk for the grazing they have provided, and we welcome their assistance as we transition to the new herds. We are, of course, excited to start working with our incoming elk, whose migration patterns and antler-shedding cycles are more compatible with the vision of the Trump White House.” At press time, many of the elk that had been fired had taken to the media to bugle in protest."
1528,"WASHINGTON—Saying he has come to dread the end of each day’s session, recently sworn-in U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch revealed to reporters Wednesday that he remains bashful about showering in front of his new colleagues. Gorsuch, who reportedly changes clothes in the Supreme Court locker room by clutching a towel to his waist and attempting to shimmy his briefs down his legs, said he feels nervous removing his robes when his fellow justices are present and is accustomed to far more privacy than what the court’s communal showers provide. “I wish there were stalls or even just a few curtains, because I’m really not comfortable stripping down around all these older justices that have been doing this forever,” said Gorsuch, who is typically the last of the court’s nine members to leave the bench and file into the locker room, where dirty, sweat-stained robes are casually removed and flung in the direction of a laundry cart. “I’ve been skipping the showers and just rubbing a little deodorant under my robes before going home, but that feels kind of gross. And waiting for everyone to leave doesn’t work because [Chief Justice John] Roberts takes super long showers and always stays late.” “Maybe if I just run in and do a really quick rinse it won’t be that bad,” continued the 113th person to serve on the nation’s highest court. Gorsuch confirmed that none of his colleagues seem to share his reservations about appearing naked before one another, noting that Justice Clarence Thomas doesn’t hesitate to tear off his perspiration-drenched robe and hop into one of the ice baths following a long day of legal deliberations. The newest and youngest member of the court added that he was especially caught off guard by 80-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy’s tendency to wander from locker to locker in the nude as he animatedly recounts and breaks down each of the day’s key arguments. According to Gorsuch, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is known to bring six-packs of Budweiser into the shower following a big victory in a landmark case, which he said is a type of behavior he never observed while on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals back home in Colorado. “There’s usually a lot of whooping and hollering after a verdict is handed down, and it can get a bit rowdy in there,” said Gorsuch, who was assigned a rusted metal locker that has reportedly remained dented since a frustrated Warren Burger slammed his fist into its door after dissenting in the 5-4 ruling ofFurman v. Georgiaback in 1972. “Last week Kennedy slingshot his dirty jockstrap into the face of one of the clerks passing out fresh robes, and Roberts hasn’t been able to get his gavel down from the ceiling since [Justice Elena] Kagan stuck it up there with athletic tape. People are always telling me how [Antonin] Scalia loved to sneak up on people changing and snap his towel on their asses, so I’m at least glad I wasn’t around for that.” “Although yesterday, when [Justice] Sonia [Sotomayor] saw I was going to wear my old swim trunks in the shower, she dumped talcum powder all over my head and called me a ‘textualist little bitch,’” the 49-year-old jurist added. Gorsuch went on to say that he is equally reluctant to lower his guard around Justice Samuel Alito, who is known to press his buttocks in the faces of unsuspecting court members when they’re sitting on the locker room’s bench and bending down to tie their shoes. Reflecting on the poor hygienic habits of his colleagues, including the propensity of some to urinate while in the shower, the former appellate judge shared with reporters his fears of contracting a staph infection like the one that spread through the locker room and prematurely ended the 1999 session of the Rehnquist court. “I realize this stuff comes with the territory, and eventually I’ll have to bite the bullet and hit the showers like everyone else,” said Gorsuch, who acknowledged he has already come to accept the open secret of the court’s widespread prescription painkiller abuse. “It’s not that I’m a prude or anything—I just feel a little self-conscious.” “Especially after seeing [Justice Stephen] Breyer’s monster cock,” he added."

1530,"WASHINGTON—Saying his administration was fully prepared in the event Congress does not pass a new budget by the end of the week, President Trump promised Monday that all essential Mar-a-Lago staff will continue to be funded during a government shutdown. “Even if Congress can’t get a budget done, the American people can rest assured that all vital cabana and golf course employees will continue to perform their duties uninterrupted,” said Trump, explaining that temporary appropriations bills would exempt crucial waiters, chefs, drivers, and housekeeping staff from any action that will close entire agencies and prevent thousands of federal employees from reporting to work. “Until a new budget gets passed, however, we will have no choice but to put all Mar-a-Lago pool boys and lifeguards on furlough and institute a hiring freeze across all landscaping departments. But while any shutdown can’t help but have some negative impact—the kitchen could run out of some appetizers, and guests’ bags might take longer to get up to their rooms—I want to assure all Americans that the core amenities of Mar-a-Lago will remain intact for the duration.” Trump went on to say, however, that if Mar-a-Lago were forced to reduce the hours its tennis courts were open, outraged citizens should blame the Democrats."
1531,"WASHINGTON—Saying that he was really worried about her and only wanted to help, Vice President Mike Pence reportedly had a long heart-to-heart conversation Friday with a staffer who came to work with coffee on her breath. “Look, I know you’re trying to hide it, but I can smell it—you’ve been drinking coffee, haven’t you?” said Pence, who had confronted aide Dana O’Brien with the allegation after summoning her to his office, gently closing the door, and assuring her that she was not in any trouble whatsoever. “I just want you to get the help you need, and if that means taking some time off work to get clean, you have my full support. And listen, I know I’m your boss, but if you want to talk to someone about your problems, you can always knock on my door.” At press time, Pence was kindly reminding another employee whom he caught drinking a ginger ale for the third time in a week that he has a wife and children who love him very much."

I’m really going to miss everything I got to do at this place—it was always such a good time. It’s hard to let go.” At press time, O’Reilly was seen wiping away a tear from the corner of his eye and popping a small down-blouse photo of a woman’s cleavage out of its frame and placing it carefully in his wallet."

In the meantime, notify police immediately if you have any additional information at all regarding this incident.” At press time, a black-clad group of 50 students were throwing bottles at the bench while chanting, “No Nazis, No KKK, No Fascist U.S.A!”"
1534,"NEW YORK—Saying she liked to believe she’d be given some kind of warning, Melania Trump idly wondered Wednesday whether she would get a heads-up if a nuclear missile were headed toward New York. “You’d think I’d receive a phone call with some sort of instructions if they knew a nuclear warhead was on its way,” said the first lady, despite being unable to recall her husband or any officials ever mentioning the existence of an alert system or notification protocol. “Maybe they have a secret shelter somewhere, and they’ll just show up suddenly to evacuate me and Barron. If they knew I was in the direct path of a nuclear weapon, surely they’d at least contact me so I could emotionally prepare, right? If absolutely nothing else, Donald would call to say goodbye and tell me he loved me, wouldn’t he? I mean, wouldn’t he?” After pondering the scenarios for a few minutes, Melania decided that, on second thought, it was probably better if she didn’t know."
1535,"WASHINGTON—In what he referred to as an important rite of passage for his 8-year-old son, Donald John III, Donald Trump Jr. took his eldest boy to the Smithsonian National Zoological Park for his first-ever hunting trip, sources said Wednesday. The daylong excursion, during which father and son could be seen wearing matching khaki fatigues and safari hats, was reportedly an opportunity for Trump Jr. to introduce the young boy to hunting by showing him how to track a wild animal through a zoo exhibit, set up the perfect shot just outside a fenced enclosure, and, if possible, hit the target right between the eyes as it lies sleeping. “That’s it, D.J.—steady the barrel along the edge of the guardrail, just like that,” Trump Jr. whispered, appearing to swell with pride as Donald John III crouched near an ice cream stand in the zoo’s Cheetah Conservation Station and took aim at a cub playing inside a small enclosure 10 feet below. “Be very quiet or you’ll spook him. Now, whenever you’re ready, just exhale slowly and squeeze the trigger.” “Great shot, son!” Trump Jr. continued as three valets from the hunting party set down the Trumps’ gear and entered the cheetah habitat to field-dress the carcass. “Let’s keep this spot until the zookeeper comes to feed them. When that happens, they’ll all move out into the open and we’ll be able to get a few more.” According to sources, Trump Jr. and his son crept quietly along the paved footpaths—staying low and occasionally ducking behind an information kiosk—in the hopes of remaining undetected as they approached their next targets, Wilma and Zora, the two American bison housed by the zoo. Both animals were reportedly lapping water from a trough and caught unaware, allowing the father-son duo to take each of them out with three quick shots to the head, use a bowie knife to cut off the horns for souvenirs, and then continue on their way to the picnic pavilion for hot dogs and sodas. Arriving at the zoo’s bird sanctuary, the Trumps are said to have switched from big-game rifles to scatterguns, bringing down a dozen flamingos, five whooping cranes, and a pair of North Island brown kiwi as zoo employees and families in the nearby gift shop screamed and ran for cover. “The key to hunting is biding your time, D.J.—wait until those sea lions are trapped between the tank wall and your line of fire so you can get a clear shot at them before they swim away,” said Trump Jr., peering through the scope of his rifle at the aquatic mammals sunning themselves on a concrete embankment. “Later, when we go inside the Great Ape House, you’re going to be tempted to take a shot right away, but you have to be patient.” “Eventually an orangutan will come down from its tire swing to grab a piece of fruit,” he added. “When that happens—bam, you nail him!” Reports confirmed the highlight of the expedition came when Trump Jr. took down the zoo’s giant panda Tian Tian with just two shots, the first bullet shattering the Plexiglas barrier and the second hitting the animal directly in the heart. The Trumps reportedly took the opportunity to pose with their prized trophy, each triumphantly placing a foot on the blood-drenched panda as a hired photographer captured the moment. The jubilant father and son reportedly ended their day by honing their marksmanship at the Small Mammal House, picking off mongooses one by one as they poked their heads out of their burrows. “D.J., I was very proud of you out there today,” a misty-eyed Trump Jr. said as he tousled his son’s hair and tenderly wiped a smear of giant anteater blood from the boy’s cheek. “Maybe someday, when you have a son of your own, you’ll take him to the zoo and kill something really great like a white rhino, or, who knows, maybe you’ll take him to an aquarium and bag a dolphin. Even I haven’t done that.” At press time, having deemed a gazelle carcass too small to make a good wall mount, the Trumps had abandoned the dead animal near a lemonade cart to rot in the sun."
1536,"WASHINGTON—A satisfied smirk spreading across his face as he watched them finish their meals, a cackling Donald Trump reportedly revealed to dinner guests Tuesday that each and every one of them had just eaten a single piece of his tax returns. “Now that you’re done dining, let me ask: Did you notice anything, shall we say, interesting about your entrées?” said the president, who caused those seated in the State Dining Room to look down at their now empty plates in revulsion as he gleefully revealed that he had diced up over 20 years of pages from his federal and New York State tax filings and sprinkled them into each of the meal’s seven lavish courses. “Dr. Bornstein, you seemed to enjoy your duck roulades. And my good professor, that crab risotto certainly agreed with you. Well, would it surprise you to learn that the dishes you’ve all just partaken of contain morsels of my 1099-Bs from 1995 to 2015? Quite delicious, weren’t they? Please, please don’t be shy about asking for seconds.” At press time, as the disgusted guests stood up from the table and hastily exited, a giddy Trump called out to remind them that they hadn’t even had dessert yet."
1537,"WASHINGTON—Rejecting calls for increased transparency by government watchdog groups, officials from the Trump administration announced Monday that they would not disclose the names of White House Diamond Elite members. “Due to the potential security risks associated with publicizing the identities of those enrolled in our most premier program, we will continue to keep their names confidential, a policy that will also apply to those at Diamond Plus, Diamond, Gold, and Silver levels,” said White House Communications Director Mike Dubke, reaffirming the administration’s commitment to the privacy concerns of program participants who enjoy a variety of exclusive premium benefits at the White House. “We will also not release the dates or times of their stays nor disclose any of the Elite Select locations they visited, as we are under no legal obligation to do so.” Pressed for further comment, Dubke encouraged journalists to contact a representative to discuss the many rewards of White House membership."
1538,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to ensure their messaging is being communicated to the public in a clear and transparent manner, the White House Press Office announced Wednesday that Sean Spicer has been given his own press secretary to answer the media’s questions about his controversial statements. “The remarks from the press secretary are being taken out of context, which is unfortunate, given the fact that he is in actuality trying to make very much the opposite point,” said Press Secretary to the White House Press Secretary Kevin Harrigan in his first briefing following his appointment to the role, whose primary duties include conducting supplementary press conferences after Spicer’s daily briefings in order to clarify and explain his comments. “If you actually look at the evidence from all sides—the substance, if not the entire whole, is solid, which is what he was trying to articulate all along. And that remains true even if the media is trying to nitpick his words and promote their own message. I understand the point, but it’s clear what he was trying to say with the aforementioned statements—even the parts he was referring to—and, um, I’m sorry, you can’t just pretend otherwise.” At press time, a contrite Harrigan was appearing on multiple morning talk shows to apologize for suggesting that if Syrian president Bashar al-Assad had a nuclear weapon, he might be the first to ever use one."
1539,"WASHINGTON—Presiding over the dimly lit chamber during the small hours of the morning, newly sworn-in justice Neil Gorsuch was reportedly forced Tuesday to work the Supreme Court overnight shift. “It’s pretty boring, and it sucks that it’s so late, but [Justice] Anthony [Kennedy] told me that doing the graveyard shift is just a rite of passage rookies like me have gone through since pretty much the beginning of the judicial branch,” said Gorsuch, adding that so far things had been fairly uneventful except for a few “kind of weird” interstate commerce cases. “There’s honestly not that much to do besides just keeping an eye on the place and dealing with whoever straggles in at 2 a.m. to file an amicus brief. Luckily, you can pretty much just read a book most of the time, and I’ve got a little portable radio to keep me company when things are really dead. Still, I’m hoping this is just for a few months before they transfer me to a normal shift.” At press time, Gorsuch was reportedly attempting to rouse a heavily intoxicated assistant solicitor general who had passed out in the back of the courtroom."
1540,"WASHINGTON—Finding himself unable to contain his jealousy toward his fellow lawmaker’s latest poll numbers, House Speaker Paul Ryan reportedly pulled aside Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) Friday to ask him what the secret is behind his 37 percent approval rating. “Hey, Joe, you’ve got to let me in on your secret—how do you manage to pull in such incredible favorability numbers? Seriously, it’s insane,” asked Ryan, cornering his fellow legislator in a Capitol building hallway and offering him increased federal funds for his district in exchange for some insight into the congressman’s enviable popularity among more than a third of voters. “I can’t even imagine what it’s like for you, having nearly two in five people approve of your performance. God, that has to feel incredible. If you could just give me a couple of tips on how to make a positive or neutral impression on that many people, I’m sure I can take it from there. Please, Joe, help me out.” At press time, a dejected Ryan was reportedly calling his closest corporate donors for some positive reinforcement regarding the job he was doing."
1541,"WASHINGTON—Amid concerns that a U.S. attack on a Syrian government air base would only escalate the ongoing conflict in the region, President Trump assured Americans Friday that his decision to order a missile strike came only after carefully considering every one of his passing whims. “I want to make it perfectly clear that the decision to launch a military intervention in Syria was the result of meticulously reviewing each fleeting impulse that I felt over the last 48 hours,” said Trump, adding that after learning of chemical weapons used by Bashar al-Assad’s forces to kill innocent Syrian civilians, he gathered his top military aides to pore over dozens of his sudden knee-jerk reactions to the situation. “I examined many different options that whirled through my mind in the moment, including authorizing drone strikes, deploying U.S. troops to Syria, sending in SEAL Team Six to take out Assad, getting up and grabbing a snack from the kitchen, doing nothing, and dropping all our nuclear bombs on Damascus at once. Ultimately, I concluded that an airstrike was the best option at that particular second.” Trump went on to say that if the Assad regime’s behavior continues, he will not hesitate to order further military action if he hasn’t already completely forgotten about Syria by then."
1542,"WASHINGTON—After ordering the first U.S. military attack against the regime of Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, President Donald Trump held a press conference Friday to express his full confidence that the airstrike had completely wiped out the lingering Russian scandal. “Based on intelligence we have received over the past several hours, the attack on the al-Shayrat air base in Homs has successfully eliminated all discussions and allegations about my administration’s ties to the Russian government,” said Trump, adding that at approximately 4:40 a.m. local time, 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from U.S. naval ships obliterated all traces of the widespread controversy in news outlets across the media. “Ordering this strike was not a decision I took lightly, but given that it was the only way to decisively eradicate any attention being paid to congressional investigations into possible collusion between key members of my staff and high-ranking Kremlin officials, I decided it was a necessary course of action. If we learn that any remnants of this scandal remain after this attack, I will not hesitate to order further strikes.” Trump went on to say that he is leaving the option open for a potential ground invasion of Syria if any troubling evidence emerges that the Russian government manipulated the outcome of the 2016 presidential election."
1543,"WASHINGTON—Expressing concerns about the propriety of being left alone with a syrup container of the opposite sex, Vice President Mike Pence reportedly asked his waiter Thursday to remove Mrs. Butterworth from the table until his wife arrived to join him at a local diner. “Excuse me, sir, would you please take this out of my line of sight until my wife gets here?” said Pence, who reportedly attempted to put the table’s sugar dispenser and salt and pepper shakers between him and the feminine syrup bottle before deciding that even having Mrs. Butterworth within arm’s reach could lead him to have impure thoughts. “It just would not be right for me to sit here alone with a woman-shaped container, particularly one as shapely as this. In fact, I would advise you to do the same for the man sitting over there—I see he is sitting very close to Mrs. Butterworth even though he appears to be wearing a wedding ring.” At press time, Pence had asked the waiter to pour syrup on his pancakes for him, as it would be unseemly to handle the curves of the plastic woman in such a public place."
1544,"ST. THOMAS, U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS—Speaking Wednesday from the grounds of the lavish tropical estate where he plans to spend much of his downtime while in office, Donald Trump unveiled a new presidential retreat he hopes will allow him to escape from the grueling pace of life at Mar-a-Lago. With its sunny climate, secluded setting, and luxurious accommodations, the 45-acre Caribbean hideaway known as Isola Vista—which sits on a pristine white-sand beach along the island of St. Thomas’ southern coast—will reportedly serve as a haven where the president can find respite from his five-star Palm Beach, FL resort and its many day-to-day pressures. “After a while, all that time spent at Mar-a-Lago starts to take a toll,” Trump said of the relentless routine of recreation and extravagance he experiences at his oceanfront Florida club. “I’m there so much that sometimes I just need to get away and clear my head. Here in St. Thomas I’ll have a place where I can simply relax and, for a little while at least, forget about all those headaches I left behind in Palm Beach.” Added the president, “A few days in the Caribbean should be all I need to feel refreshed and ready to get right back to the usual grind of Mar-a-Lago.” According to sources, considerable efforts have been made at Isola Vista to create a tranquil retreat far removed from the rigorous schedule of golf, fine dining, and spa treatments the commander-in-chief faces every single day he is in Florida. His stressful days at Mar-a-Lago reportedly begin at 6 a.m. with a breakfast prepared by a Michelin-starred chef, followed by an early tee time at the award-winning Trump International Golf Club. By the time the last wearying soiree at his private club finally winds down, the president is often completely exhausted, aides say, prompting his decision to decamp to Isola Vista for some much-needed rest and leisure. “It’ll be great to fly down here from Mar-a-Lago and have a little me time,” said Trump, describing how the new retreat will finally let him enjoy some peace and quiet away from his exclusive members-only Florida resort. “The amount of unwinding I’ve done in Palm Beach lately has left me completely drained. Hopefully Isola Vista will allow me to recharge anytime I overdo it at Mar-a-Lago and start to feel run down.” Following his first visit to Isola Vista, presidential advisers confirmed Trump’s time away appeared to have had a positive effect on his mood and energy level. “The new retreat seems to have worked wonders on the president,” Trump aide Jessica Ditto told reporters. “When he returned to Mar-a-Lago, he was eager to dive right back into his packed daily schedule immediately and couldn’t wait to get started on the day’s first hot-stone massage.”"
1545,"WASHINGTON—Admitting there was simply too much on his plate right now to bring stability to the fractious region by end of day Friday, Senior Advisor to the President Jared Kushner quietly moved the task “solve Middle East crisis” to his to-do list for next week, sources reported Tuesday. “Ushering in lasting peace across the Mideast is definitely still a big priority for me, but given everything else I’ve got going on right now, I’m just going to need to bump it to next week when I have a little more time on my hands,” Kushner reportedly said as he crossed out the task on his pocket day planner and rewrote it on the following page, acknowledging that he was just “too swamped” at the moment with policy reports and real estate development meetings to resolve the numerous wars, land disputes, and centuries-old ethnic and religious tensions that have long raged among the 350 million residents of the geopolitical hotspot. “I was really hoping to at least knock out the Arab-Israeli conflict before the weekend, but this week’s kind of gotten out of hand. It’ll be fine, though—I’ll just carve out an hour or two next week, hunker down in my office, and sort it all out then. If I can push back a couple business calls, I can definitely get this whole Middle East situation ironed out by Wednesday—Thursday at the latest.” At press time, Kushner reportedly pushed “solve Middle East crisis” back an additional 30 minutes after deciding it would be better to get “fix America’s opioid epidemic” out of the way first."
1546,"WASHINGTON—Telling Americans this was the kind of leadership and accountability they could expect from the GOP, congressional Republicans held a press conference Monday to celebrate making good on their 2009 promise to block the president’s healthcare bill. “Eight years ago, our party made a solemn pledge to do everything in our power to ensure that a healthcare bill put forth by the president of the United States did not become law, and through our actions last week, that is exactly what we have done,” said Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who declared that Republican leaders had never forgotten the vow they made almost a decade ago and noted that, when presented earlier this month with a comprehensive healthcare reform plan championed by the White House, they quickly stopped it in its tracks and refused to relent until it was dead. “True to our word, we successfully prevented the executive branch from pushing through a sweeping bill that would have completely remade the U.S. healthcare system. When we said in 2009 that we would not let the president enact a plan that would affect tens of millions of Americans, that was not just empty rhetoric, and on Friday, we stood up and put an end to the president’s bill for good. Voters will not forget our resolute action.” McCarthy went on to add that throughout the remainder of this term, the American people could count on their Republican representatives to uphold the vows they made repeatedly between 2008 and 2016 to obstruct the president’s agenda at every turn."
1547,"PALM BEACH, FL—Noting that it had already been there for almost two weeks, Mar-a-Lago assistant manager Chris Mahoney reportedly wondered Monday if anyone was coming to collect the nuclear briefcase from the club’s lost-and-found. “Someone noticed it in the dining room and dropped it off, and it’s just been sitting at the bottom of the bin ever since,” said Mahoney, adding that he had been asking people coming to collect their lost scarves and sunglasses if they might also have misplaced a briefcase attached to a pair of handcuffs. “You’d think whoever it belongs to would have realized that they lost it by now. Well, I’ll give it a few more weeks—if no one claims it after 60 days, it’s up for grabs, and I can see if someone on my staff wants it.” At press time, a man had mistakenly claimed the briefcase as his own before getting home to discover all the unfamiliar buttons inside."

1549,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the legislation would create major gaps in treatment for tens of millions of people, a new report released Thursday by the American Public Health Association found that anxiety disorders induced by Donald Trump’s presidency will not be covered under the new GOP healthcare bill. “Under the proposed American Health Care Act, those experiencing anxiety over the impact of the Trump administration on the economy, civil rights, or the environment, or just suffering from generalized distress over the future of the nation, will have to pay exorbitant out-of-pocket expenses for any therapies required to cope,” said policy analyst Jason Coates, adding that not even the groups who will need treatment most, such as immigrants, women, and the poor, would be covered. “Even as President Trump continues to enact more of his controversial agenda and make antagonizing public statements, millions will remain vulnerable to the resulting mental health issues. And if left untreated over an entire four-year term, they could develop into more serious conditions that will end up costing taxpayers much more in the long run.” The report also acknowledged, however, that Trump-related anxiety would result in billions of dollars in savings for elder care due to the shortened lifespan of many seniors."

We’re gonna have ourselves longer, harsher sentences, and make no mistake, I do not just mean for adults. You had all best get ready, ’cause you’re gonna have some company in those cells real soon, and they’ll be staying for a mighty, mighty long time.” At press time, an inmate who had interjected that overall violent crime rates were at historic lows was thrown into solitary confinement “from now until Judgment Day” for talking back."
1551,"WASHINGTON—Saying the issue was an urgent matter of national security, FBI director James Comey said at a press conference Tuesday that the agency required increased surveillance powers in order to keep pace with the continually evolving threat of presidential administrations. “Even with the vast tools we currently have, the FBI simply cannot keep up with the growing dangers posed by presidents, their cabinets, and other staffers,” said Comey, who called for a significant expansion of the agency’s investigative capabilities, including investing in state-of-the-art surveillance technology and hiring many more field agents to offset each new threat from an administration as it emerged. “Of course, keeping the country safe from presidencies is not solely within the purview of one agency, and we welcome the cooperation of the NSA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the CIA, as well as state and local law enforcement, in our investigations.” Comey cautioned, however, that even if the FBI had vastly expanded powers, it was still only a matter of time before a presidential administration horrifically attacked America once again."

Don’t get me wrong, I like working with you guys out there, but I had that nomination dead to rights, and they snatched it away from me.

1556,"WASHINGTON—Defending his proposed elimination of the federally funded agency, President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that the wasteful National Endowment for the Arts hasn’t even produced a single valuable work since Claes Oldenburg’sGiant Three-Way Plug. “We have not seen one single NEA-backed project come close to justifying its cost since the Swedish-American sculptor debuted his Pop Art masterpiece in 1970, challenging the way we grapple with questions of industrialization and decay,” said Trump, adding that taxpayer dollars shouldn’t support an organization whose body of work includes such underwhelming artistic efforts as the Joffrey Ballet’sThe Rite Of Springand the entirety of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival. “Sure, William Bolcom’sSongs Of Innocence And Of Experiencemoved me at times, but for every Pulitzer Prize–winning composer the NEA supports, it also funds 20 more derivative jazz quartets.

After all, I might be doing this for years.” Robart went on to say that he was also planning to save valuable research time by directing his clerks to gather all previous U.S. legislation dealing with unlawful detentions, racial profiling, and internment camps."

1559,"WASHINGTON—Seeking to open his mind to new possibilities for overhauling the U.S. healthcare system, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) reportedly witnessed an infinite number of replacement plans Wednesday after dropping acid to inspire ideas for an Obamacare alternative. Shortly after the 75-year-old Republican senator ingested two 100-microgram tabs of LSD in his Congressional office, sources said countless substitutes for the Affordable Care Act began to explode before his eyes in luminescent, hyper-vivid colors and patterns. “Oh my God—I can see the CHIP provisions spreading out in every direction forever and ever and ever,” said a reeling McConnell, gazing wide-eyed as infinite, interlocking fractal combinations of health savings plans, employer-provided coverage, and government subsidies enveloped him in an accelerating stream, eventually passing over him with such velocity that they appeared to be an entire galaxy of stars swirling around him. “Now I can see…I can see the outpatient hospital visits covered for every child in the country! No, every child who’s ever been born, and will ever be born! Even the ones who haven’t yet been conceived!” “The scope of coverage is so beautiful,” added the senator quietly. “Whoa.” According to sources, McConnell’s hallucinations came on slowly, first appearing as a geodesic block grant spiraling gently in the center of the senator’s desk before morphing into a gigantic, prismatic spiderweb of plans whose out-of-pocket prescription expenses expanded and contracted with McConnell’s every breath. McConnell then reportedly turned his attention to the pulsating, roiling carpet in his offices, from which an entire ancient forest sprang as though from the beginning of time, its vines and verdant, leafy canopy composed of untaxed dollars that reached to the ceiling, beneath which the senator said the “whole country would be protected,” eliminating penalties and subsidizing care for 150 million eligible Americans. “Every co-pay is connected to every patient is connected to every beating human heart,” said McConnell as he began to peel off his suit and tie until he was completely nude. “The individual mandate is total bullshit, because the plan is life itself, and you can’t opt in or out of life. And the continuous coverage incentive—well, it’s fucking this! All of this! The river and the sky and the grass and the trees. And it’s you! You and me. We’re all part of the plan.” “Fuck, I’m tripping balls,” added McConnell, waving his hands in front of his face and attempting to grasp at the low-cost, high-value brackets that had presented themselves as glowing orbs. McConnell reportedly grew terrified, however, after claiming to see the skies darken and a huge wall of 400-foot-high premiums rising in the distance while thousands of jagged, ugly shapes representing an overburdened Medicaid system rained down around him, threatening to crush the middle class and, eventually, the whole human race. The senator then fled his office on foot and sprinted into the Capitol rotunda, where sources said he stopped dead in his tracks to stare open-mouthed at the domed ceiling for the next 90 minutes, mumbling in horror about an upper limit on the tax preference for employer plans before the naked and sweating congressman ran out onto the National Mall. Sources later told reporters that at one point, the senior senator from Kentucky caught sight of his own face in the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool and began to panic, insisting that he saw himself waiting in an out-of-network doctor’s office for 10,000 years due to his own proposed legislation before decaying completely, his flesh falling from his bones in rotting chunks. “He was really freaking out, so I brought him a glass of orange juice and that seemed to calm him down a bit,” said aide James Scholtz, adding that McConnell became fixated on Scholtz’s striped tie and rubbed it gently on his face while repeatedly stating that he no longer feared the massive impact to the federal budget that sweeping healthcare reform would bring—that he in fact welcomed it. “I couldn’t really follow everything he was saying, but he was pretty adamant that his body was an HMO, Earth was the network, the universe was the insurance company, and God was the free-market exchange. Eventually he started crying, so I just patted his hand until [Secretary of Transportation] Mrs. Chao came to talk to him.” After the drug’s effects had worn off, Senator McConnell reportedly surveyed his notes, called them “nonsense,” and then picked himself up from the K Street alley where he had found himself, ready to move ahead with his plan to repeal Obamacare without a replacement."
1560,"WASHINGTON—As a growing number of interest groups, politicians, and media outlets continue to voice criticism of the proposed American Health Care Act, a report published Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found it was totally unclear if opposition to the bill from every last sector of American society would have any effect on whether or not it passes. “Although the AHCA has been condemned from persons all along the political spectrum, not to mention literally everyone else with an informed opinion, it’s still uncertain if any of that will have any bearing on whether the bill is signed into law,” read the report in part, adding that there was no way to tell whether widespread resistance to the bill from healthcare providers, Democrats, and both moderate and conservative Republicans would diminish in the slightest its ability to secure a majority of votes in Congress. “So far, the bill has drawn criticism from the AARP, the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, Planned Parenthood, Breitbart News, the AFL-CIO, the House Freedom Caucus, the National Council of La Raza, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Club for Growth, the National Disability Rights Network, MoveOn.org, The New York Times, Tea Party Patriots, the CATO Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and thousands of hospitals—even if you combine all that with the White House’s own decision to cautiously distance itself from the legislation, passage of the AHCA is still somehow very much an open question.” The report went on to conclude that opposition from average voters was certain to have no impact on the bill whatsoever."
1561,"WASHINGTON—Saying that you will have no choice but to discover them one by one as news unfolds, a report released Tuesday concluded that you will learn the names of three separate reprehensible public officials this week. “Before the week is up, the identity of three public officials whom you previously didn’t know existed will be revealed to you based solely on their utterly disgraceful conduct,” read the report in part, adding that even a casual scan of the week’s headlines will be sufficient to introduce the names of these three loathsome individuals into your vocabulary. “While the names you’ll learn this week might belong to individuals who serve the government in different capacities, all will be equally despicable. You might become acquainted with them from their separate betrayals of public trust or from their contributions to a single larger outrage—either way, there is no avoiding these terrible people.” The report also warned that although you will learn the names of three additional reprehensible public officials next week, that will in no way help you forget those you learned this week."
1562,"WASHINGTON—Excitedly drafting an email after discovering she had been included in the article, White House deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh reportedly sent her parents aNew York Timesarticle Monday that quoted her as an anonymous source. “Check it out, I made it onto the Times homepage!” read Walsh’s email to her mother and father, including the link to an article in which she is cited only as a “White House aide” while describing the dysfunction within the West Wing. “They only used a little bit of what I said, but I’m the one talking about how increasingly isolated Trump was and how he was alienating members of his inner circle. It’s the second anonymous quote, not the first—I actually have no idea who gave that one.” Walsh’s email reportedly also reminded her parents to record60 Minutesthis weekend in the event Steve Kroft uses the classified memos she leaked to him."
1563,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to address concerns about the affordability of coverage, Republican congressional officials advised Americans Monday to set aside the income from one of their jobs to pay for healthcare costs under the newly introduced American Health Care Act. “Under this bill, you would simply set up a separate savings account for the total earnings from one of your jobs, which will ensure that you can comfortably cover your healthcare expenses each month,” said House Speaker Paul Ryan, adding that the GOP’s proposed Affordable Care Act replacement would keep healthcare costs for the average American from exceeding the entire salary of one full-time job. “If you budget things correctly, you’ll have plenty of money left over from your other job or jobs to spend on food, rent, and any other personal expenses. In some cases, healthcare will even be low-priced enough to afford using only the income from a part-time side job on the weekends. The important thing here is that this legislation will allow Americans—not the federal government—to decide for themselves what kind of healthcare they want and how many jobs they choose to have in order to pay for it.” Ryan also recommended that in order to be prepared for the added costs of a sudden medical emergency, Americans should create a dedicated savings fund using the money from at least two of the mortgages on their homes."
1564,"PALM BEACH, FL—Having struggled to haul more than 30 pounds of highly classified documents for 18 holes, Mar-a-Lago caddy Simon Bauers reportedly injured his shoulder Sunday while carrying a set of President Donald Trump’s national security briefings around the resort’s golf course. “I definitely felt a sudden twinge of pain while walking to the 12th hole with all of President Trump’s intelligence briefings slung over my right shoulder,” said Bauers, adding that he was forced to lift the large, unwieldy assortment of CIA and FBI briefings with his left arm for the remainder of the day. “Hopefully it isn’t anything serious, but by the end of the day, I could barely pick up a few binders of intel on North Korea’s ballistic missile capabilities, let alone all the dossiers on ISIS. I might have to go see a doctor tomorrow if the pain doesn’t go away.” Bauers went on to say that he is at least glad Trump’s set of briefings has gotten far lighter ever since intelligence officials decided to withhold sensitive information from the president to avoid White House leaks."

1566,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the White House chief strategist’s skin stretched and bulged as the animal scurried about, sources confirmed Tuesday that a rodent was clearly making its way through Steve Bannon’s body during a national security meeting. “You could see the outline of a rat or maybe a very large mouse scampering inside Mr. Bannon for the entire 90-minute strategy session,” said Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland, adding that at one point the rodent-shaped lump paused and turned in circles several times before darting down the former Breitbart editor’s neck. “I tried not to stare, but the thing kept peeking its head out of Steve’s nostrils. I just had to look away when its tail popped out of his left tear duct.” At press time, White House sources confirmed that a faint squeaking noise could be heard every time Bannon opened his mouth to speak."
1567,"MUSCAT, OMAN—Sifting through various items in his dresser and closet, 36-year-old Omani graduate student Raed Saleh told reporters Monday that he was not sure how many days’ worth of airport detention clothes to bring for his upcoming trip to the United States. “I definitely want to pack enough to last me the entire time I’m detained at Newark International Airport, but I also don’t want to overdo it,” said Saleh, adding that five T-shirts would likely be enough to avoid having to do laundry while he is being held for questioning by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. “I’m definitely going to pack a whole week’s worth of socks and underwear, and even though I doubt it’ll be too cold inside the cordoned-off holding area at customs, I should definitely have a sweater just in case. But I can just wear my jeans every day and then throw on some pajama bottoms at night so I’ll be comfortable sleeping inside the airport terminal.” At press time, Saleh had decided to also pack a book of sudoku puzzles to occupy himself in case his phone and laptop were illegally confiscated during his detention."
1568,"MOSCOW—Working frantically to readjust the schedule they had outlined back in June 2015, Russian officials admitted to reporters Thursday that they have been left scrambling after seeing their plan to delegitimize Western democracy move much faster than they had intended. “We originally had a two-to-four-year timeline to carefully undermine the legitimacy of the American political system, so we’ve had no choice but to suddenly push ahead on a few things we didn’t expect to even start talking about until at least 2018,” said Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, adding that following the recent forced resignation of Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, Russian officials had prepared for perjury allegations against Attorney General Jeff Sessions to arise sometime in mid-May at the earliest. “We were right where we wanted to be around November after slowly destroying the credibility of the Democratic party over the course of the prior year, but we never thought so much public trust in the White House would erode in a matter of a few weeks. We’re pleased, of course, but keeping up is going to be a real challenge.” Lavrov went on to say he was deeply concerned that Trump’s impeachment would occur well before the president could cause the amount of damage to America that the Kremlin had originally intended."
1569,"WASHINGTON—Angrily dismissing offers of a plea deal if he would agree to cooperate with an investigation into the current administration’s ties to Russia, Attorney General Jeff Sessions reportedly spit in the face of an FBI interrogator Thursday who was attempting to convince him to turn on President Trump. “If you goddamn Feds want to know whether I’ll turn rat: Here’s my answer,” said Sessions, shortly before leaning over the small wooden table separating him and his interrogator and spitting directly into the FBI official’s eyes. “I’m not gonna crack, so you G-men can threaten me with whatever the hell you want—you’re just wasting your time. I’ll fucking die before I flip, so you got the balls to kill me?” At press time, Sessions had reportedly begun to break down and was frantically divulging everything he knew after agents asked him how long he thought he would last on the inside with all the people he had helped put away on marijuana charges over the years."
1570,"WASHINGTON—Expressing surprise and sadness at Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ repeated denials of contact with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign, heartbroken Ambassador Sergey Kislyak told reporters Thursday that he thought his special meetings with the then–Alabama senator were actually very memorable. “To be honest, our two conversations hold great significance for me, and I can’t help but be upset to learn that Jeff felt otherwise,” said the tearful Russian diplomat, adding that he simply could not believe that Sessions could so nonchalantly dismiss the many hours they spent discussing the intimate details of their lives, including their innermost hopes and fears for their respective countries. “It really hurts to think that Jeff doesn’t cherish the afternoons we spent sitting in his office exchanging information about everything under the sun. These were some of the most meaningful discussions of my life, and Jeff’s writing them off like they didn’t even happen. How could he be so cruel?” Kislyak went on to say that even his subsequent communications with former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn never for a moment made him forget the precious time he and Sessions spent together."
1571,"LEXINGTON, MA—Interrupting the two-time presidential candidate in the middle of her speech, a member of the Ruby Tuesday waitstaff reportedly warned Jill Stein Tuesday evening that her official Green Party response to President Trump’s congressional address was disturbing the restaurant’s other patrons. “Excuse me, ma’am, but if you wouldn’t mind lowering your voice a bit so other guests can enjoy their meals,” server Teresa Whitman politely asked Stein, who had spent the last several minutes railing against Trump’s plan to lower the corporate tax rate by 20 percent in front of a corner booth containing four other members of the Green Party. “We appreciate your dining with us this evening, but multiple tables have complained that your shouting about excessive military spending is upsetting their children. If you can’t speak at a reasonable volume, we’ll have no choice but to ask you to leave.” At press time, a defiant Stein was arguing that she had already purchased several rounds of Ruby Relaxer cocktails and was therefore entitled to denounce Trump’s proposal to cut $54 billion from non-defense-related federal programs as loudly as she wanted."
1572,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to keep himself virtuously occupied during President Donald Trump’s speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, Vice President Mike Pence was reportedly passing time by mentally baptizing all of the senators in attendance. “Do you desire to obtain eternal life in the church of God through your faith in Jesus Christ?” Pence imagined himself asking every senator in the chamber, contentedly working his way down the aisles to welcome each of the legislators into the fold by tipping their head into the cleansing waters of the Lord. “Upon your profession of faith and accordance with the Lord’s command, I baptize you, Senator Feinstein of California, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. May His everlasting light be with you always. Let us pray.” At press time, Pence had reportedly begun mentally stoning all 435 fornicators in the House of Representatives as the president’s speech entered its second hour."
1573,"WASHINGTON—Stirring the emotions of citizens across the nation with his strong and affecting rhetoric, President Donald Trump outlined a bold vision for the country’s next mass protests during his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night. “My fellow citizens, we have an ambitious agenda ahead of us,” said the president before laying out a far-reaching plan to establish hundreds of new protests across the country that will draw millions of Americans onto major city thoroughfares and outside state capitol buildings, and more still to march on Washington. “We’ve already started to realize some of this vision, but, folks, this is just the beginning. We have a long way to go. Things are going to be much different under this administration.” Trump cautioned, however, that in order for his dream of immense nationwide protests to reach its full and historic potential, he would need Congress to be on board with his ideas."
1574,"WASHINGTON—Pulling around the acoustic guitar slung over his back and slowly strumming a D chord that rang throughout the House Chamber, President Donald Trump performed his self-written song “The Story Of America” Tuesday night before a joint session of Congress. “Well, our tale begins way back in 1775 in the American colonies, when a group of men took on a tyrannical king who had forced them to live on their knees,” said Trump, who sat atop the rostrum while playing the four-minute-long fingerpicked song that told of Washington crossing the Delaware River and how the patriot Nathan Hale “swung from a tree in the name of liberty.” “So each time you gaze upon the beautiful red, white, and blue, remember the brave men who risked their heads to secure freedom for me and you. Now, everybody clap along!” After concluding the song and pausing to retune the strings of his guitar, Trump reportedly then began playing a slow ballad called “When Uncle Sam Got Jew’d.”"
1575,"WASHINGTON—As part of the standard contingency plan to ensure continuity of the American populace following a major catastrophe, sources confirmed that Jake Hyland of Kansas City, MO will serve as the nation’s designated survivor during President Donald Trump’s Tuesday evening address to Congress. “In the event that a terrorist attack or other disaster kills the other 324 million U.S. citizens tonight, Mr. Hyland would serve the vital role of assuming all the duties of the American people going forward,” said Secret Service director Joseph Clancy, adding that the 43-year-old digital marketing manager has already been escorted to a secure, undisclosed location, where he will remain throughout Trump’s speech until authorities deem that the entire country’s population is no longer at risk of being collectively wiped out in a single cataclysmic event. “Mr. Hyland is currently being briefed on all necessary protocol and will be fully prepared to act as the sole remaining member of the country’s citizenry if necessary.” Clancy stressed, however, that order of succession would fall to higher-ranking Americans such as 57-year-old Jessica Perry of Fort Wayne, IN or 49-year-old Alexis Monroe of Harrisburg, PA if they were to also survive."
1576,"WASHINGTON—Noting that the tight-knit group rarely associated with others, shy ex-Citigroup executive Harold Burke told reporters Friday that he has been struggling to fit in with the popular clique of ex–Goldman Sachs executives at the White House. “They’ve all known each other for years, and they have all kinds of inside jokes, so it’s really hard to break in,” said Burke, adding that he has tried several times to hang out with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, National Economic Council director Gary Cohn, and several other former Goldman Sachs executives, but always felt excluded. “I see them in the hallways at the White House all the time, but I might as well be invisible. Every once in a while, I’ll eat lunch with the guy from JPMorgan Chase. Usually, though, I just end up finding a quiet stairwell by the East Wing and sitting alone.” At press time, Burke had resigned himself to making friends with the group of weird oil industry guys who always hang out by the Capitol."
1577,"MOSCOW—Lamenting that internal disorganization was making it extremely difficult to get anything done, Russian officials voiced their frustration Thursday about continuing struggles to get policies through the dysfunctional Trump administration. “You’d think that after being in the White House for a month, they’d have at least some rudimentary process for rolling out our new proposals, but it’s just been a mess so far,” said Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, adding that the recent dismissal of Michael Flynn as national security advisor was “just the tip of the iceberg” in a chaotic White House where internal conflicts and numerous leaks made it hard for the Russians to implement any workable ideas at all. “Nobody, but nobody, knows who’s in charge. If they’re not dragging their feet getting our new legislative demands in front of Congress, they’re rushing out some executive order before we’ve even finalized it. We don’t know what’s going on half the time, so how on earth are we supposed to get anything accomplished?” An exasperated Shoigu went on to say that the administration was in such disarray, rolling back sanctions might take a year longer than planned, and abandoning NATO might actually be out of the question."
1578,"WASHINGTON—Fearing the information had already fallen into the wrong hands, the FBI was panicking Tuesday after learning encrypted national security communications may have been intercepted by the Trump administration. “We are incredibly troubled to have learned that transmissions vital to homeland security could have been captured and decrypted by President Trump’s staff,” said FBI director James Comey, who said agency servers were rapidly being destroyed as a precaution while an urgent investigation was conducted. “If it turns out that Trump officials have indeed acquired these correspondences, it could mean the entire United States security architecture is compromised. We want to assure the American people, however, that we are doing absolutely everything in our power to determine what, if anything, has been obtained by these volatile and dangerous individuals.” At press time, the FBI’s worst fears had not yet been realized, as the Trump administration did not appear to be acting on any information from national security agencies whatsoever."
1579,"WASHINGTON—Fully mindful of the privilege he enjoyed, Trump administration staffer Greg Potreski told reporters Friday that he was grateful to be working with so many individuals he could turn over to the FBI in exchange for immunity. “It’s such an honor to be surrounded by almost countless people who, if it ever came down to it, I could hand over to the authorities in order to escape prosecution,” said Potreski, adding that he never imagined he’d find himself in a workplace that was staffed wall-to-wall with professionals whose comparatively more serious crimes he could expose to save himself. “I’ve held positions in government before, but I’ve never had an experience like this—there’s an opportunity for me to do no jail time in every single office. I learn so much just by talking to these folks.” When asked by reporters, Potreski’s colleagues said they were equally grateful to have someone like him at work."
1580,"PALM BEACH, FL—Saying that the noisy group was really getting on his nerves, Mar-a-Lago country club member Walter Forsyth reportedly complained to the management Thursday about the obnoxious U.S. cabinet meeting seated at the next table. “I just wanted a nice, quiet dinner, but this rowdy table of high-ranking government officials keeps rudely shouting about classified policy initiatives,” said Forsyth, adding that more than a dozen raucous aides and advisors had pulled up chairs to a table that was clearly only meant to seat six. “I didn’t pay all this money in membership fees to have these insufferable officials barge in and take over the entire dining room with their piles of sensitive documents spread out everywhere like no one else is even here. I’m just trying to enjoy the prime rib, and they’re on their phones loudly talking to some foreign leader. This is the same disrespectful group, of course, that was yelling about North Korea in the spa.” At press time, a waiter was politely asking the party to take their conversation about the Iran nuclear deal into the bar area or the lobby."
1581,"New revelations from the U.S. intelligence community about potentially illegal communications between members of the Trump administration and Russian officials, which led to Michael Flynn resigning as national security advisor Monday, have increased calls for a wider investigation of Trump’s murky ties to Russia. Here’s what you need to know. A: Violating the Logan Act, which states that American civilians must wait until after they take political office to commit treason. A: The humble general doesn’t like to draw too much attention to his collusion with foreign governments. A: An outspoken advocate of intervention in the Middle East, Flynn is known to have a somewhat short memory. A: All evidence thus far suggests that Trump hasn’t been cognizant of the world outside his head since at least 1993. A: We’re talking about a completely different cozy relationship with Putin right now, okay? A: Psychologists believe that while sociopaths can seem friendly with one another, they’re unable to form the type of bond required for meaningful relationships. A: No. A: Nothing a few news cycles can’t bury. A: As a matter of professional decorum, they would never dream of impugning a sitting president."
1582,"WASHINGTON—Marveling at the outraged, shouting woman’s conditioning, House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Tuesday he could not help but be impressed by the infuriated protester who had been keeping up with his running pace for the last nine miles. “She’s extremely irritating, and I absolutely disagree with her political views, but I’ve got to hand it to her for maintaining a consistent seven-minute mile this whole time,” said Ryan during a morning run around the Tidal Basin, adding that the woman’s stamina was particularly impressive considering she had sustained a steady chant of “Do your job!” since she caught up with the Wisconsin Republican alongside the Jefferson Memorial more than an hour earlier. “I honestly thought she would have lost steam on lap three and given up, but her endurance and aerobic capacity are absolutely incredible. She hasn’t lowered her sign even once. I wonder what kind of regimen she’s on.” After a quick cooldown, Ryan told reporters the protester’s energy had been particularly helpful in preparing him for an upcoming triathlon, and he hoped the woman would be back again at 6 a.m. tomorrow to take him to task for having no viable Obamacare alternative."
1583,"WASHINGTON—Pledging to defend the highest laws of the United States as objectively and consistently as possible, Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch vowed Monday that if confirmed, he would interpret the Constitution in accordance with former Associate Justice Antonin Scalia’s original intent. “The Constitution is not a living document to be reinterpreted in light of new values, but one that was meant to be understood according to the opinion originally laid down by Justice Scalia,” said Gorsuch, who promised to strictly adhere to the letter of Scalia’s jurisprudence when ruling on all cases before the court. “When Justice Scalia first wrote his opinions on subjects like civil rights and the commerce clause, he set down a blueprint that all justices should follow. Our job should always be to respect those original words, not to redefine them to fit modern attitudes.” Gorsuch added that Scalia’s original intent was still a reliable guide to evaluating the nation’s laws, even if the country we lived in was no longer one the associate justice would have recognized."
1584,"WASHINGTON—Telling reporters they were working hard to provide important national security updates to the new commander-in-chief in a manner he found most useful and actionable, intelligence officials confirmed Monday they have been struggling to condense President Donald Trump’s briefings down to a single word. “The president prefers his briefs to be concise and straightforward, preferably no longer than two or three syllables, so we’re now focusing on compressing each day’s classified intel and any intercepted geopolitical chatter down to the sole most salient word,” said Deputy National Security Advisor K.T. McFarland, adding that a team of staffers had been tasked with stripping each briefing of the overly technical or complex details that President Trump disliked, such as arcane insider terminology, multiple bullet points, and any compound or hyphenated words. “The president tends to grow frustrated if crucial intelligence is not delivered within the first seven letters or so. We recently gave him a briefing that consisted only of the term ‘nuclear proliferation,’ but he clearly became distracted by the end of the first word, so we shortened it to simply read ‘bomb,’ and he seemed to respond well to that.” At press time, McFarland confirmed President Trump had asked officials to continue formatting his daily intelligence memos in the model of his most recent briefing, which consisted entirely of a brightly colored clip-art fighter jet."
1585,"WASHINGTON—Revealing that the president’s chief strategist had been observed scuttling around the residence to gather materials, White House aide Alison Fordham confirmed Friday that Steve Bannon was mixing a discarded climate change report with his saliva to construct the final wall of his nest. “Over the last couple weeks, Bannon has been shredding environmental research papers with his teeth and combining the scraps with his own sputum to create a gray, viscous pulp that’s slathered on his mound in the corner of the Roosevelt Room,” said Fordham, who witnessed the assistant to the president grinding up a 200-page document on CO2 emissions in his mandibles, producing a tortured moan, and then violently retching for several minutes before spewing the partly digested, putrid substance on the floor. “It appears that the walls of Bannon’s nest were made from the hardened paste of several FBI dossiers on domestic terrorist groups and notes from several intelligence briefings, as well as a few pigeon skeletons.” At press time, White House officials confirmed that Bannon had completed his nest and was now showing signs that the eggs in his brood sac were ready for host injection."
1586,"WASHINGTON—Saying that nothing in his journalism career could possibly have prepared him for this, Politico chief White House correspondent Mike Allen wondered Thursday where to mention getting yelled at by the president of the United States in an article he was writing. “I can’t put it in the lede, of course, but I probably should at least bring up the fact that the commander-in-chief took nearly a full minute out of the press conference just to ream me out,” said Allen, adding that while he was intensely uncomfortable at the thought of inserting himself into his own piece, the lengthy, belittling tirade was an objectively newsworthy moment deserving a full paragraph or even the focus of an entire story. “God, how do I even refer to myself in this? It’s weird if I say ‘The president then yelled at a reporter from Politico,’ but I also can’t say ‘And then the president yelled atme.’ Jesus, do I also have to include him saying I should be fired?” At press time, Allen was relieved to learn that he would not have to face this dilemma again, as he would no longer be called upon in press conferences."
1587,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to respond to the vast and ever-changing dangers faced by the nation’s commander-in-chief, Secret Service administrators announced Wednesday the creation of an Emotional Protection Division to safeguard President Donald Trump’s psyche. The new unit’s three dozen agents, who have undergone rigorous training to prepare for their challenging role, will be charged with defending the 45th president’s psychological well-being around the clock, investigating foreign and domestic threats to his self-esteem and quickly intercepting any spoken or written criticisms before they can harm his pride. “After conducting a full review of the operational procedures available to us, it became clear that adding this new division was the only way to meet President Trump’s emotional security needs,” said Secret Service director Joseph Clancy, noting that the president’s detail is specially trained in assessing risks and minimizing any opportunity for him to feel insecure or belittled. “His psyche could be put in grave danger from unfavorable poll numbers or suddenly come under attack from a White House press corps heavily armed with uncomfortable questions.” “All of our agents stand ready to lay down their lives to ensure nothing can hurt President Trump’s feelings.” “All of our agents stand ready to lay down their lives to ensure nothing can hurt President Trump’s feelings,” he added. According to officials, the Secret Service is reportedly conducting careful background checks on White House visitors to look for any red flags, such as A-list celebrities who might choose to decline a photo op with Trump. The department has also instituted measures to screen the president’s mail for messages that do not reinforce his belief in his own superiority, and to sweep any room before he enters to remove high-risk copies ofThe New York TimesandThe Washington Post. High-ranking agency sources told reporters that their tireless efforts have already made the president’s psyche significantly more secure. In particular, they cited occasions in which agents have shielded Trump against credible attempts on his vanity, saying they have kept him away from photographs on the internet in which he appears in an unflattering light and from news reports indicating that some television programs have garnered higher ratings simply by mocking him. “We’ve already had one really close call,” said Clancy, citing an incident in which a member of the Secret Service jumped directly in front of Trump to prevent him from seeing primetime news coverage of massive rallies held to protest his administration. “But the moment we detected a risk, a few brave agents rushed in to surround the president and place their hands over his ears, safely ushering him into his motorcade before he could hear more than a few words of criticism.” “The president was then immediately taken to a secure location where he was evaluated for any injury to his self-importance,” Clancy continued. While acknowledging the assignment’s significance, several agents bemoaned the difficulty of keeping a vigilant eye upon the constantly evolving risks to Trump’s feelings, observing that whenever the president travels, the Secret Service must vet his destination days or even weeks in advance to ensure it is free of anything that could pose any risk of offense. “It’s incredibly demanding work because his ego is such a big target,” said Roger Mercer, 36, an agent in the Emotional Protection Division. “There are new threats emerging every hour, and if even one of them gets through to him—really gets through to him—it’s all over.” “I can already tell the next four years are going to be the hardest of my career,” he added."

1589,"WASHINGTON—Acknowledging the longtime aide’s many years of service, House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Tuesday that his conscience would no longer serve as a key policy advisor. “While my conscience has played an important role in helping me develop a number of policies to this point, it will nevertheless be stepping down from the position effective immediately,” said Ryan, whose resolve to officially dismiss his conscience reportedly reflected its markedly decreased influence over his decision-making in recent years. “Unfortunately, I find myself consulting with my conscience less and less on important issues affecting our citizens. While I am grateful for its guidance, I’ll be proceeding without it as of today. Its departure will surely be felt by our team and no doubt throughout Washington.” At press time, Ryan announced that all policy-making going forward would be guided by his self-interested cowardice, which the speaker said would be an indispensable partner for the foreseeable future."
1590,"WASHINGTON—Saying he would surely rise to the occasion if tasked by the Almighty with the ultimate test of faith, Vice President Mike Pence said Monday that he was disappointed that God has never called upon him to kill one of his own children. “It’s just heartbreaking that the Lord hasn’t summoned me once to show my dedication to Him by sacrificing one of my precious kids,” said Pence, telling reporters that he has spent years waiting for any sign at all from the Heavenly Father that he should ritually slaughter one of his three children. “They’re grown now, so I’m starting to think I’ll never get the chance to offer the blood of any of them to prove my unshakable devotion.

1592,"WASHINGTON—Saying they have had to deal with hundreds of new cases over the last few weeks, local D.C. authorities reported Friday that they are struggling to keep squatters out of empty State Department offices. “We’ve had to work around the clock to make sure nobody is sleeping or setting up camp in all the office space left vacant by departing State Department personnel,” said D.C. police spokesperson Eric Marshall, adding that 20 to 30 calls were coming in every day regarding transients who have moved into State Department headquarters, including homeless addicts seen injecting heroin on mattresses in one of the former diplomatic reception rooms. “Even when you don’t catch the squatters, you can see the hot plates, garbage, and sleeping bags in the hallways. And just last night, we had to chase out a bunch of teenagers who lit a bonfire in the lobby, not to mention all the stray cats that have pretty much sprayed urine on every conference room wall.” Marshall added that the city might have to consider condemning the building if conditions did not improve, which, at press time, the Trump administration had not objected to."
1593,"WASHINGTON—Alarmed at the prospect of unconstitutional overreach by the Trump administration, millions of fearful Americans have already begun stockpiling facts before the federal government comes to take them away, sources confirmed Friday. “I know my rights as an American, so you’d better believe I’m getting my hands on as many facts as possible and keeping them somewhere safe where this First Amendment–hating president of ours can’t snatch them all up,” said Pittsburgh resident David Edelman, 38, adding that he was worried that President Trump planned to not only suspend production of facts, but also seize existing ones, leaving Americans and their families completely defenseless. “The minute I saw Trump, I knew he was someone who didn’t grow up around facts or the kind of folks who use facts. Well, the founding fathers cherished my right to possess facts, and they’d be rolling in their graves if they knew the Feds were going to bust in and try to steal our facts in the middle of the night.” A spokesperson for the Trump administration dismissed such fears, saying that the president merely wanted to keep facts away from certain dangerous people."

Why, what would dear grandpapa Frederick think if we were to violate them? So you see, dear father, I musn’t and I shan’t! Indeed, I will stop up my ears with wax before I entertain another syllable of this inquiry.” At press time, Trump had fled the room in distress, saying he must leave forthwith lest he hear one more question on this most vexing of topics."
1595,"WASHINGTON—Hoping to ride a wave of momentum after a historically strong year, the nation’s stomach ulcers predicted Thursday that the Trump administration will provide opportunities for unlimited growth in 2017. “The outlook for the coming year is just fantastic—in fact, we could see an unprecedented expansion of ulcers under President Trump,” said an ulcer representative, adding that the mood around the country was ideal for the prosperity and advancement of the gnawing internal lesions, and that there had already been a record increase in Trump’s first week alone. “For stomach and intestinal ulcers alike, there’s just a new sense of energy and inspiration under Donald Trump. Frankly, we haven’t seen this much confidence since World War II.” Despite its optimism, however, the membrane rupture conceded that the growth of ulcers may within months pale in comparison to that of coronary blockages."
1596,"WASHINGTON—Praising the federal appellate judge’s commitment to upholding the Constitution, President Trump hailed his Supreme Court justice nominee Neil Gorsuch as a fierce protector of the future amendment that will allow the president to temporarily suspend the right to assemble. “I am confident that Judge Gorsuch will do everything in his power to see that every line of the Constitution, including the forthcoming amendment to grant the executive branch the power to halt all public protests, will be safeguarded as the law of the land,” said Trump, adding that Gorsuch’s strict adherence to the country’s supreme law, both in its present and very near future iterations, was what drew him to the 49-year-old judge in the first place. “If his track record is any indication, Judge Gorsuch will act as a stalwart defender of our nation’s founding legal document, which will soon contain a 28th amendment granting the president sole authority to restrict the public’s ability to collectively air grievances. He has my full vote of confidence in these matters.” Trump went on to say, however, that Gorsuch was also practical enough to know when certain parts of the Constitution didn’t need to be taken quite so seriously."
1597,"WASHINGTON—Stressing that the very future of the republic was at stake, President Donald Trump called upon all Americans Monday to stand strong and resolute in the face of empathy. “Now, more than ever, we as a nation must remain steadfast in resisting the urge to understand the feelings and perspectives of others,” said Trump, adding that a rising tide of dangerous empathy could, if unchecked, quickly engulf the country in compassion. “Above all else, we must never descend into treating people as separate individuals with their own concerns and desires, deserving of sympathy and respect. That is surely the path to kindness, from which a nation seldom returns.” Trump went on to say that the courage Americans demonstrated today would allow future generations to one day look at the world around them with indifference or, with any luck, pure disdain."

1601,"WASHINGTON—Following a series of incidents that left food and used paper products scattered throughout the West Wing, White House staff were reminded Friday to place lids firmly on all trash cans after President Trump’s senior advisor, Steve Bannon, got into the garbage again. “It’s imperative that everyone securely fasten their receptacles so as not to attract Mr. Bannon by the smell of rotting fruit or moldy bread,” said White House chief usher Angella Reid, noting that Bannon was crafty and could work his way into almost any type of bin if there was even the smallest gap. “Just last week, he tracked old coffee grounds through the Roosevelt Room and then left a pile of chicken bones under the Resolute desk. This problem is getting out of hand, so if everyone steps up, it’ll mean a lot less sweeping for all of us.” Reid added that any staffers who encountered Bannon while he was feeding could attempt to shoo him away by loudly clapping their hands, but should not directly approach him, as he could be carrying some sort of disease."
1602,"WASHINGTON—Dismissing concerns that the controversial interrogation method constituted torture, President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that waterboarding does not even come close to the excruciating torment he himself experiences at every waking moment. “Prisoners who are forced to endure a few hours of simulated drowning hardly experience the unrelenting horror that tears at my psyche night and day,” said Trump, adding that being strapped to a chair in a filthy concrete cell and repeatedly suffocated was a “stroll in the park” compared to the cruel and inhuman anguish his mind is subjected to literally every single second. “What is having gallons of water forced into your lungs compared to the nightmare that has never once released its grip on me? Waterboarding only brings a prisoner to the brink of death. I die a thousand times a day.” Trump went on to say that unlike the victims of the brutal interrogation technique, he was relentlessly tormented by the miserable fact that he deserved everything that was happening to him."
1603,"NEW YORK—In response to his repeated failure to reimburse creditors for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans, sources confirmed Thursday that a collection agency is holding the nation as collateral until President Donald Trump pays off his business debts. “We will retain full possession of all 50 states as security for the more than $2 billion the president owes,” a spokesman for Parsons Credit Services said, adding that the company was holding the entire Pacific Northwest as a guarantee against the $364 million in transferred loans the commander-in-chief had borrowed from Deutsche Bank alone. “Due to the significant scope of the president’s debts, as well as the lengthy amount of time he has been delinquent—decades, in some cases—we have no choice but to hold the entire expanse of the United States until his obligations are paid in full. And if President Trump’s late fees and interest continue to accumulate, we’ll require additional collateral in the form of Puerto Rico, Guam, and American Samoa.” The collection agency also emphasized that if Trump did not completely satisfy his debts within the next 180 days, it was prepared to repossess the nation and have it sold off at auction."
1604,"GREENVILLE, SC—After 36 hours on the run through the woodlands of South Carolina, a bloodied and exhausted Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) reportedly cowered behind the trunk of a willow tree Wednesday as President Donald Trump’s vicious hunting dogs closed in on him. According to sources, Graham has spent the past day and night wading across frigid creeks, slogging into fetid swampland, and crashing through thickets of thorny brambles in an effort to evade Trump’s pack of hounds, but he has not been able to shake the president’s determined hunting party. “Please, God, let me make it out of here alive,” the 61-year-old senator whispered to himself, trying to quiet his ragged breathing as the animals frantically searched the ground just above the hollow where he lay hiding. “Please.” “If I can just make it to Virginia, [former Rep.] Scott [Rigell] will help me—he has to,” added Graham, apparently unaware the same dogs had ripped the recently retired Republican congressman to pieces a few days prior in reprisal for calling Trump a “con man” during the presidential campaign. Local sources said the chase began early yesterday after Graham was tipped off that Trump was approaching his Greenville congressional offices with a retinue of valets, who were seen struggling to control two dozen baying foxhounds as they strained at their leads in a frenzied bloodlust. Trump’s dog handlers reportedly rubbed a necktie belonging to Graham under the animals’ noses, with one of the valets commenting that the dogs were particularly agitated, having already “gotten the taste of blood from Jeb.” After bolting for the nearby woods, Graham was said to have evaded Trump’s dogs for several hours by slicing open his own hand with a sharp rock, smearing his blood on a tree, and scrambling up an embankment in the opposite direction to throw the animals off his trail. However, reports suggest the hounds were able to pick up Graham’s scent again after discovering a torn piece of the senator’s suit pants on a shrub into which he fell after tripping over a tree root and badly twisting his ankle. Now hobbled, Graham is believed to have spent several freezing hours sleeping fitfully under a rocky overhang, only to be awakened by the sound of the dogs’ sudden approach. Sources confirmed the senator has not been able to escape the range of Trump’s retinue since that time, and has begun to see flashes of the commander-in-chief’s red field jacket between the trees as the sound of his hunting horn comes ever closer. “I said I’d vote to confirm [Secretary of State nominee] Rex Tillerson!” Graham shouted into the woodland shadows as he tried to hide his figure behind the tree trunk. “I gave you that! What else do you want from me, you bastard?” At press time, Trump’s dogs were reportedly charging toward Graham, who, standing at the crest of a waterfall and seeing no better option, leapt into the deadly rapids hundreds of feet below."

1607,"WASHINGTON—Activating the reserve military forces to assist in the urgent mission, President Donald Trump reportedly deployed the National Guard to a press conference Tuesday in order to provide him with a standing ovation. “We received orders from the commander-in-chief at approximately 0600 hours to mobilize all available units in the D.C. area to the White House press briefing room, where personnel were instructed to supply a thunderous round of applause at the conclusion of President Trump’s prepared statements,” said Chief of the National Guard Gen. Joseph Lengyel, noting that hundreds of reserve troops had been directed to clap and cheer after Trump spoke on such hot-button issues as the economy and his relationship with the press. “The National Guard is prepared to swiftly respond to the president’s need for vocal adulation. We’ve got boots on the ground in cities across the U.S. to answer the call for ovations at rallies, diplomatic meetings, treaty negotiations, and all other manner of official appearances.” At press time, dozens of troops had been marshaled to chant the president’s name as he signed executive orders dismantling the Affordable Care Act."

1610,"WASHINGTON—Noting aspects of the job he enjoyed as well as offering what he hoped would be helpful criticism, Barack Obama reportedly filled out a lukewarm review of the presidency on the employer review website Glassdoor a few days after exiting the position last Friday. “In terms of pros, you get to travel a lot and there’s lots of free food—also super dog-friendly,” wrote the 44th commander-in-chief in an anonymous three-star review, selecting the box for “former” employee and choosing “full-time” from the employment status drop-down menu. “In terms of cons, though, the hours are terrible for your work-life balance, and it’s often hard to get anything done because there’s so much red tape, not to mention all the cliques and office politics (frankly, lots of asshole coworkers). All kinds of responsibility but very little recognition for accomplishments, which definitely starts to wear on you. I ultimately don’t think I’d recommend this job to others.” At press time, other Glassdoor users noted that the unnamed person who wrote the review seemed to have a much harder time than the previous position holder, who described the job as “usually tons of fun.”"
1611,"Listen, I completely understand why everyone is furious with me. You don’t think that I know there are disgusting, reprehensible, dangerous things coming out of my mouth at all times? That my vile, indefensible words seek only to shelter the nation’s newly installed administration from the slightest shred of accountability? And that I’ve done it all with a self-righteous arrogance that suggests outright contempt for the truth and our nation’s founding principles? Of course I do. I have behaved in ways that defy not only logic and common sense, but also basic human decency. And, deservedly, I have been shamed and criticized and insulted for these actions. But answer me truthfully: Who among you wouldn’t do the same exact thing if an evil 400-year-old witch had trappedyourfather’s eternal soul inside a cursed iron lantern, flickering faintly each time his agonized moans escaped the murky, otherworldly ether that is his prison? Look me in the eye and tell me that you would not heed the crone’s disgusting instruction to divert attention away from Donald Trump’s glaring conflicts of interest, nor undermine the nation’s entire intelligence apparatus to salve your boss’s ego, nor categorically deny objective reality time and time again if so doing released your father’s tortured spirit from the in-between realm and at last let him be at peace. Do you actually think I enjoy appearing on television on behalf of a petty and profoundly unstable narcissist to defend his taped admissions of sexual assault? And as a woman, do you think I like attacking the victims of such horrible abuse as the mouthpiece for that conscienceless degenerate? Do you think it’s my idea of a good time to slay the fearsome Beast ofObar Chiardairwith an opal blade and return to the witch its bloody horns, or to pretend I can stand being anywhere near Eric Trump? Rest assured, I do not. But I have no choice. I must do these foul deeds to free Papa, thinking only of his pained, spectral face slowly disappearing and reappearing behind that accursed, clouded lantern glass while I again take to CNN and lie about where funding for the border wall is going to come from. When I go home at night, please know that I do three things. I sit and I weep at the positions I have taken. I retch in horror at the potential consequences my words will have on civility, reason, and the safety of citizens in our country. And I stare with sunken eyes at the glow of Papa’s soul in the lantern, shining brighter only when I’ve successfully advocated the unconscionable position that Betsy DeVos is a qualified candidate for Secretary of Education, or growing dimmer when I haven’t adequately shouted down members of the press by claiming that their fact-checking efforts are a sign of the media’s unforgivable bias against this administration. Know that when I work up the courage to look myself in the eye, I see the ghoul I have become. Please understand, it makes me blanch and tremble to even think about what I’ve already done, and what I yet still must do. But I don’t have a choice, and neither would you. Had you yourself tried to kill the witch and smash the lantern for the hundredth time and seen your own mother transformed into a millipede for your efforts—finally coming to terms with the fact that the crone’s magic is simply too strong—you too would find yourself standing up for Trump’s attack on a celebrated black U.S. congressman and Civil Rights icon. Do not claim that you wouldn’t. Could I have avoided this fate? Certainly. Though I warned my father time after time of the dangers of stealing mandrake root from the mystical garden of a powerful hag so that he could once again briefly feel the strength of his youth—oh, your vanity, Papa!—clearly I could have and should have done more. But I can’t dwell on the past now; I simply don’t have time. I’ve completed seven of the 12 tasks and now must shore up Trump’s acceptance of anti-vaccination theories and steal a newborn foal’s first breath before the witch draws the moon down from the sky and sets in motion the Final Degradation. I am so sorry—sorry for what I’ve done, and even more sorry for what is to come. Forgive me. I love you, Papa."

1613,"WASHINGTON—Admonishing those responsible for failing to uphold their moral duties, Vice President Mike Pence expressed disappointment Saturday in the 200,000 husbands and fathers who had allowed the women and girls in their charge to attend the Women’s March on Washington. “I can’t tell you how let down I feel by the heads of these households who did not simply give their wives and daughters a firm, decisive ‘no’ when they asked to participate in today’s demonstration,” said Pence, noting with frustration that many of the protesters had been granted permission to travel across the country alone and stay for several days in a faraway city with no male chaperone whatsoever to guide and look after them. “There are a few men marching as well, so they must be the ones supervising this whole thing, and thank God for that. But I can’t help but feel that these ladies’ custodians—the ones who were supposed to be providing a masculine voice of reason on these sorts of matters—have really come up short today.” Pence stressed that he, for example, had told his 23-year-old eldest daughter that it was simply out of the question when she mentioned she was thinking of attending the march."
1614,"WASHINGTON—Activating a set of intense desires and personal drives that had until that moment remained dormant, the experience of seeing thousands of people marching in his honor during Friday’s inaugural parade reportedly unlocked a deeper, darker corner of President Donald Trump’s psyche than had previously been known to exist. According to reports, these heretofore uncharted recesses of Trump’s mind—containing thoughts and impulses completely unfathomed by the American public—were accessed for the first time by the sight of waves of uniformed citizens striding in formation combined with the knowledge that he was now the leader of them all. Sources confirmed that the newly triggered bundle of synapses sprang into action in response to the spectacle, causing an entirely unexplored facet of the recently sworn-in president’s personality to awaken and assert its influence over his behavior and ambitions. At press time, an even darker chamber of Trump’s innermost being had reportedly been stirred into action after he was saluted by hundreds of military personnel."
1615,"WASHINGTON—Jotting down the instructions so the incoming commander-in-chief would be able to quickly and easily access the personal information of the American populace without any hassle, outgoing President Barack Obama left a Post-it note on the White House kitchen counter Friday explaining how to use the government’s extralegal surveillance apparatus, sources confirmed. “Domestic surveillance can be a little tricky—check to make sure NSA is connected to ISP servers first,” read the bulleted message in part, which went on to direct President Donald Trump to “keep trying” several times if a request for communications records from private internet and telecom companies didn’t work on the first attempt. “Select whether data will be collected by individual or in bulk. Download it. IMPORTANT: MAY NEED TO EXPAND STORAGE TO HANDLE ALL DATA. That’s it! Enjoy! P.S. If leak happens, you’ll have to wait a while, then reboot the whole thing.” Obama reportedly also left a stack of classified files regarding American citizens suspected of terrorism overseas on top of the Resolute desk with a note inviting his successor to “help yourself!” to any targeted killings."
1616,"WASHINGTON—Saying he needed to turn his life around before “ending up in deep shit,” outgoing Vice President Joe Biden was reportedly hatching plans Friday to go completely legit now that his term in office has concluded. Biden, who longtime aides confirmed had made numerous phone calls inquiring about good, honest minimum-wage jobs, vowed to cease taking part in a variety of scams and petty crimes and move far away from the nation’s capital, where he believed he could finally make something of himself and become a productive member of society. “I’ve lived like there’s no tomorrow for fuck knows how many years now, but mark my words, sooner or later, if I don’t straighten out, some hardass will be throwing Uncle Joe in the joint or a pine overcoat,” said the vice president, who expressed a deep sense of regret that his back-alley street dice game, his “plum” fencing racket, and his bootleg merchandise operation had caused so much pain for loved ones. “Everybody knows trouble fits me like a pair of tight cutoffs that only cover half your ass cheeks. I’ve done plenty of things I’m not proud of, and a whole lot more that I sure as hell can’t remember. Got nothing to show for it except a few scars, a bitchin’ spoiler on the Zam, and a rap sheet longer than my dong.” “From now on, I gotta keep a low profile and steer clear of Johnny Law,” continued Biden. “It’s time for Ol’ Joe to play it straight.” The vice president reportedly took a long drag from a cigarette and slowly exhaled through his nostrils while describing the shady deals and criminal offenses that ultimately led to his sudden desire to “get [his] ass in gear” and “ditch this dump of a city once and for all.” Biden told reporters he had grown sick of the all-night parties, sleeping in past noon every day, and keeping his head on a swivel for rival “bud peddlers,” hired guns, and any number of “batshit crazy” members of Congress he had “gotten into dustups with” during his six terms in the Senate. In addition, White House officials confirmed that Biden had repeatedly asked outgoing President Obama in recent weeks to pull a few strings to enroll the 74-year-old in the Federal Witness Protection Program. “I’ve been on the horn hitting up Barry to do me a real solid and help old Joey Scranton out of this jam,” said Biden, adding that a fresh start in a faraway place with a new identity would be the easiest way for him to leave “the game” and keep him out of county lockup. “Lately, all my ‘sure things’ have been pretty iffy, so I don’t give a rip where I set up shop. I just need to cut out and stop rubbing elbows with a bunch of good-for-nothing dirtbags like the Gooch, T-Bone, and Pelosi, who will sell you out in zero seconds flat as soon as the fuzz start sniffing around.” “I can hang my hat anywhere and keep myself squeaky clean as long as I’ve got some green coming in and Blaze at my side,” the vice president added. “I also asked Barry to do right by Jill and hawk a pound of the dank yerba I stashed up in the fireplace in the Oval Office so she has a sweet nest egg. Might not make it back to these parts, so I told him to say so long to Jilly for me, since I’m not into big send-offs.” The vice president informed reporters he was ready to settle down and find a profession that was on the level, noting that he would be “sitting pretty” as long as he landed a job that brought in $12,000 a year, and mentioning he would gladly accept a “real cushy” position washing dishes at a restaurant, fetching shopping carts at a supermarket, or selling car parts at a reputable chop shop. Biden added he was also “keeping an ear to the ground” for any roadie gigs “hauling amps” for Foghat. “I’m too damn old to be living outside the law anymore—you can’t keep pissing into the wind forever,” Biden said. “I just want to be a totally upright citizen who busts his hump for the man all day, punches the clock, and then heads home to pull bongs until dawn. Just like everybody else.” At press time, sources confirmed Biden heard the sound of distant sirens, stated “I gotta tear ass out of this rathole town,” and scrambled out a second-story window."
1617,"WASHINGTON—Joining the ranks of the unemployed at a time when joblessness remains stubbornly high among African Americans, 55-year-old local black man Barack Obama has lost the full-time job he has held for the past eight years, sources confirmed Friday. A father of two and his family’s sole breadwinner for much of the past decade, the dismissed African-American employee was reportedly instructed to vacate his workplace by the end of the week, after which he will no longer be on his employer’s payroll. “Minorities continue to face challenges in the job market even when they possess extensive qualifications and experience,” said Gerald Harmon, chief economist with the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University. “While the U.S. economy has enjoyed a record 75 months of continuous job growth, the grim reality for Mr. Obama is that the unemployment rate among black Americans continues to hover at around 8 percent.” “We’ve seen tremendous gains since the labor market bottomed out seven years ago, but unfortunately for this man, and many other people of color, we still have a long way to go,” he continued. According to sources, the local black resident has cycled through at least three different occupations since turning 40, and was in serious danger of losing his job four years ago. Reports indicate that after taking the position in 2009, he faced daily antagonism from his mostly white colleagues, who reportedly never stopped questioning his qualifications and competence, a situation that is said to have made it difficult for him to perform the duties assigned to him. As such, sources asserted that the man faced greater challenges in the workplace than a white person with the same job would have, and had to work much harder to achieve even the smallest amount of respect. Acquaintances noted the working conditions soon began to take a visible toll on his health. “What makes his circumstance even more tragic is that the job he had wasn’t even that great to begin with,” said Harmon, citing the long hours, difficulty of tasks, and toxic work environment that characterized Obama’s former position. “It was better than nothing, sure, but we’re talking about some really grueling and thankless work here.” Harmon added, “His position was emblematic of the kinds of high-stress, low-reward jobs that African Americans are often relegated to in our economy.” Because he obtained healthcare through his employer, Obama will now have to purchase insurance to cover his family’s medical expenses, which experts said is an option that will soon become exceedingly expensive if lawmakers vote to do away with the few affordable plans currently available to individual consumers. In another devastating blow, the family is reportedly expected to lose their home. “Even though everyone in the Obama family is out of a job, it sounds like they’re going to stick around the neighborhood and try to make things work,” Harmon said. “But it wouldn’t be surprising if we eventually see them wind up like millions of others, particularly fellow minorities, who find themselves in the same position: moving back to their hometown, where they have relatives and friends they can lean on.” “Regardless, the employment outlook isn’t bright for an older person of color with Obama’s work history,” he added. “At his age, someone like him might just while away his remaining years moving between various part-time positions and focusing on his own personal hobbies. It’s unlikely he’ll ever land a job as steady or as meaningful as the one he was just let go from. Unfortunately for him and so many others, that’s just the sad reality of the situation.”"
1618,"WASHINGTON—Stopping and turning around as he made his way across the South Lawn after hearing the unmanned aerial vehicle hovering just feet behind him, outgoing President Barack Obama tearfully shooed away a loyal MQ-9 Reaper drone attempting to follow him out of the White House, sources confirmed Friday. “Go on now—get out of here!” said the former commander-in-chief, his lower lip trembling and his eyes welling with tears as he affected a stern tone of voice in an attempt to scare off the faithful hunter-killer drone that had spent the past eight years obediently at his side. “You can’t come with me anymore, you got that? Can’t you see this is for your own good? Now scram. What are you waiting for? Go!” At press time, a heartbroken Obama had thrown a rock in the drone’s direction, causing the unmanned aerial vehicle to flee into the sky, where it paused to look back one last time at its old master before flying off toward a Yemeni tribal wedding."
1619,"WASHINGTON—Leaving the nation in an uneasy state of dread as he spoke from the Capitol steps, incoming President Donald Trump reportedly delivered a disturbing inaugural address Friday in which he repeatedly threatened to work hard to implement his campaign promises. “Everything that I’ve stood for in this campaign, all of the goals I’ve set, I will work around the clock until each one of them is achieved,” Trump ominously warned the country, prompting inauguration attendees and those watching at home to exchange tense, fearful glances with nearby friends and loved ones as the newly installed president made several additional intimidating assertions that he would “seek to enact” the agenda he had espoused throughout his run for office. “My focus now will be turning my campaign pledges into reality. It is my guarantee to you, the American people, that I will do my best to accomplish everything I said I would do when you elected me president.” A collective gasp was then reportedly heard emanating from the National Mall as Trump issued a sinister threat to begin swiftly carrying out his campaign’s plans as soon as his speech concluded."
1620,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the task was simply one of many professional responsibilities he is required to perform, Chief Justice John Roberts reportedly stopped partway through administering the presidential oath of office Friday, turned to face those gathered on the National Mall, and reminded them this was just part of his job. “Please raise your right hand and repeat after me: I, Donald John Trump, do solemnly swear—hey, just so everyone knows, it’s not like I’m choosing to be up here; it’s just something I’m kind of obligated to do,” said Roberts, who asked those in attendance and those watching at home to keep in mind that with few exceptions, every United States president has been sworn in by the chief justice, and that he couldn’t really do anything about it at this point. “I just want to be perfectly clear: I didn’t volunteer for this. I’m just carrying out a duty that comes with being head of the Supreme Court and that’s it. Got it? Okay—do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States.” At press time, Trump had also paused while reciting the oath of office to remind the audience that regardless of whether or not he intends to adhere to anything the oath stipulates, saying it aloud was just part of his job too."
1621,"WASHINGTON—Closing his eyes and taking a deep breath before making his way to the lectern, President Donald Trump reportedly calmed his nerves before his inaugural address Friday by reminding himself that he is the only person who actually exists. “Relax, Donald, you are the only person in the world; there is no one else but you, so there’s nothing at all to worry about,” said Trump, seeking to clear his mind of all distractions by silently repeating to himself that he is the sole being in the entire expanse of the universe and the only entity capable of perceiving or feeling. “Everything is going to go great. Just remember there is not another single soul anywhere. Nobody else has ever existed or will ever exist aside from you. You and you alone are alive and real. Okay, this will go great.” At press time, President Trump confidently stepped up to the microphone and delivered a spirited inaugural address to a completely captivated and proud self."
1622,"WASHINGTON—Carefully weighing the pros and cons of each option from his seat onstage at Donald Trump’s inauguration, former president Jimmy Carter is, according to late-breaking reports, currently contemplating dying right here and now. “Maybe now’s the time to go,” the 92-year-old reportedly thought to himself Friday, pondering whether to continue viewing the ongoing ceremony for the incoming president or simply release his tenuous grip on existence and pass to the other side. “I could slip away right now, or maybe wait until the middle of the inaugural address. Or I could keep watching the proceedings and then return to my home. Hmm.” At press time, Carter had shifted his gaze upward from Chief Justice John Roberts to a strong beam of light that seemed to be bathing his body in a bright, warming glow."
1623,"WASHINGTON—Telling reporters he needed to get his “digs back into primo condition” as quickly as possible, Vice President Joe Biden was seen scrambling around Friday morning in a frantic attempt to clean up Number One Observatory Circle just hours before his successor was scheduled to move into the residence. Biden, who said he needed to get the place “real fucking clean” because the incoming resident was a “total tightass,” reportedly spent his last remaining moments in the home darting from room to room prying Keystone Light cans and empty bottles of Jose Cuervo from the sticky wooden floors and tossing them into heavy-duty black plastic trash bags. According to sources, the vice president paused frequently to sniff the Colonial- and Federal-style furnishings, spraying an aerosol disinfectant on anything that smelled “iffy.” “I thought the casa might need a little tune-up before I gave back the keys, but this is way more of a shitstorm than I bargained for,” said the outgoing vice president, who then opened a second-story window to hurl out a heavily stained 200-year-old rug that was a gift from the British ambassador Viscount Halifax. “Truth be told, I’m not even sure how it got fucked up so bad. I guess Dynamite Joe must’ve raged harder than I remember.” “I’ll do my best to give the place a good scrubdown, but I can’t guarantee there won’t be a few ‘souvenirs’ left over from my time in the saddle,” continued Biden, picking out shards of a broken lava lamp from the cushions of a damask settee that was draped in several large beach towels to hide its numerous cigarette burns. “Shit, clock’s a-ticking. I better get a move on.” According to aides, Biden crammed several embroidered drapes into the 123-year-old home’s washing machine, sprinted into the kitchen, where he dumped an entire bottle of detergent into a sink overflowing with Lenox china, and then left the faucet running as he grabbed a piece of coarse steel wool and turned his attention to buffing out the words “Ratt” and “Crüe,” which had been carved in large letters into the decorative molding of his dining room chair rail. The winded and perspiring vice president was reportedly later seen hurrying around the residence, using a piece of cardboard torn off a Cutco knives box to sweep an array of peanut shells, old scratch-off tickets, half-empty packets of ramen noodles, and Kameleon-brand condom wrappers under various armoires and antique couches. According to reports, Biden then rushed to move a dresser originally belonging to Aaron Burr in front of a hole that he said had been punched in the wall by “one of Arne Duncan’s douchebag pals” during his 2010 State of the Union after-party. Sources confirmed that Biden worked incessantly throughout the morning, pausing only to crank up Warrant’s “Cherry Pie” on a battered boombox he had propped up on a chair in the reception hall. “Ain’t got time for dicking around, since I still have to figure out what shit I’m taking and what I’m gonna hawk to the new suckers,” said Biden as he furiously sifted through a pile of his best “wank mags,” before tossing a weathered 1982 issue ofFlinginto a box labeled “Keepers.” “And as for the rest of this fancy crap, they say it’s all property of the Navy, but I’m sure as hell ganking a flat-screen TV or two.” “I did my time helping Barry take care of business—nothing wrong with making it worth my while,” the vice president added. When pressed on his moving van’s arrival time, Biden revealed he had declined the government’s contracted moving company in favor of his buddies Paco and Skuzz, with whom he reportedly went “way the fuck back.” The vice president admitted that while the two men weren’t professional movers, they had lots of experience handling “valuables” and could be trusted to look the other way at his “office supplies,” including roughly four and a half pounds of “some real dank Bubba Kush.” Additionally, Biden said he could use any extra time to scrub the carpet in the sitting room, where he had done a significant amount of spray-painting while souping up a red 1979 Harley-Davidson Electra Glide that he repeatedly referred to as his “cherry chariot.” “It blows that I have to spend my last few hours here cleaning up instead of savoring all the good times we had livin’, lovin’, and rockin’ our sacks off,” said Biden, who decided to leave behind a prized butterfly sex swing for the incoming second family. “Besides, what’s the point? I’m gonna end up tossing most of this stuff in the trashola anyway.” “Except the twins,” the six-time Delaware senator continued, tucking a Budweiser-brand, life-size cutout of two scantily clad cowgirls under his arm. “They’re coming with Uncle Joe.”"
1624,"WASHINGTON—Sighing wistfully while recalling all the times the psychedelic artwork helped get his “rocks off,” Vice President Joe Biden reportedly grew emotional Thursday as he carefully took down a blacklight poster of a topless barbarian chick from his office wall. “Man, you have no idea how many times staring up at that badass warrior babe’s grade-A rack picked up Ol’ Joe when he was deep in some shit,” said a teary-eyed Biden, who cautiously removed the array of masking tape, poster putty, staples, and thumbtacks affixing the “total mindfuck” print to the wall to avoid damaging the image of the “completely stacked” female warrior. “This was the first and only thing I put up in my office. Hell, I never even bothered to unpack most of these boxes. Damn, that’s a sweet sword. She’s one wild lady-savage with some exotic, tribal powers; let’s just say she’s always known how to charm the snake. Yeah, she’s served Diamond Joe real well, and I can tell Barry likes her too.” At press time, Biden started sobbing uncontrollably while packing up a “High St.” street sign that he and his buddies T-Bone and the Gooch had stolen shortly after he was sworn in as vice president."
1625,"GROZNY, RUSSIA—Coming eye to eye with the mysterious guerrilla mastermind he had been hunting for the past several years, a shackled Secretary of State John Kerry looked on Thursday as a notorious and brutal Chechen terror leader removed his mask to reveal the scarred face of Kerry’s former mentor. “No, it can’t be—the explosion in Iran, the fire—you’ve been dead 15 years,” said the bruised and bloodied U.S. cabinet official, staring in disbelief at the former black-ops expert who had taken Kerry under his wing and spent years training him in espionage, explosives, and martial arts before his apparent death while sabotaging an Iranian oil pipeline. “It’s been you this whole time, hasn’t it? You were behind the kidnapping of the Russian attaché, the uranium stolen from Seversk—all of it. How could you turn your back on everything we fought for? I looked up to you. I trusted you!” At press time, Kerry was promising his mentor that he had watched him die once and he would do it again."
1626,"Many Americans are upset right now. To millions, the outcome this past November seemed like a step backward for the United States, and people are understandably worried about where our nation might now be headed. But my fellow citizens, now is not the time to give in to pessimism or defeatism, because the future—and I’m talking, like, 35,000 years in the future—is still bright. Admittedly, this is a troubling time for our country, one where it seems like decades of progress on social and environmental issues could be at risk. But when you look ahead—and again, I mean way,wayahead, to at least the 370th century or so—there’s still plenty of cause for optimism. Things may not get better today, or the next day, or while any of us, or our children, or any of our great-great-great-grandchildren’s great-great-great-grandchildren are still alive. But someday, 1,300 or 1,400 generations from now, Americans will look back on this moment as just a temporary obstacle on our nation’s continued path to greater equality and prosperity. Tomorrow still offers us hope—and, of course, here I’m using “tomorrow” as a figure of speech to indicate a date 30 to 40 millennia from the present. That’s because America is stronger and more durable than any one presidential administration. As a nation, we have faced periods of crisis before and have always come out stronger on the other side. Whether this one lasts a year, 10 years, 100 years, or through several cycles of global glaciation and retreat, we can rest assured that when looked at on a cosmic scale, we will make progress. That’s why all of us need to continue working to ensure that our descendants, whether human or whatever post-human species we evolve into over the next several geological epochs, can inherit a world—either Earth or an as-yet-undiscovered life-sustaining planet that our kind must flee to—better than the one we have today. Yes, things may look bad right now, but when our founding fathers set down the laws that guide this nation, they created a blueprint that has survived everything from economic depressions to foreign and civil wars. And I am confident that it will survive the literally hundreds of coming economic crises, civil wars, environmental catastrophes, thermonuclear conflicts, and an intermittent series of centuries-long global dark ages as well. Until once again, likely no more than 13 million days from today, America emerges from our current troubles as an even better and more perfect realization of its formative ideals. So, continue to keep hope alive in your hearts, and know that when you zoom really, really, really, really far back to look at the big picture, our nation is still marching forward toward a fairer, freer future for all Americans. That is, unless the president-elect wins a second term. In which case, right now is the best it’s ever going to get."
1627,"WASHINGTON—Urging staffers to keep their eyes peeled for a “scaly little fucker without any legs,” Vice President Joe Biden reportedly searched the White House one last time Wednesday for his missing 12-year-old pet coral snake, Fruit Loop. “Look, I just found a discarded skin on a chair in the Roosevelt Room, so I know he’s still slithering around here someplace,” said Biden, who sources confirmed rummaged through the drawers of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and crawled around on his hands and knees peering underneath furniture for the 3-foot-long snake. “Fruit Loop can’t be far—he usually hauls ass straight for the East Wing whenever he flies the coop. If you hear something weird going on in the pipes, just get me on the horn and I’ll come lickety-split with a pole to snatch him. I can’t fuck up again—I’m already on thin ice after he mixed it up with Bo during the 2014 Easter Egg Roll.” At press time, Biden was dangling a dead mouse near the White House kitchen’s oven and calling the snake’s name."
1628,"WASHINGTON—Explaining that the experience would be extremely awkward for each side, President Barack Obama told reporters Wednesday he is really hoping not to run into the U.S. populace after his term ends. Obama said that once his presidency officially draws to a close on Friday, he would ideally have little or no interaction with his 324 million former constituents, adding that if he ever unexpectedly crossed paths with the American people while going for a walk or doing errands, he hoped they could each quickly continue on with their day with just a passing exchange of pleasantries. “I’m going to try to steer clear of them, but it’s really only a matter of time before I bump into them on the street or out at a restaurant or something,” said Obama, emphasizing that while he had nothing against the United States citizenry personally, it would be highly uncomfortable to make forced small talk about how they’re doing and what they’ve been up to recently. “It’s not like I can avoid them forever. I have to go to the supermarket, don’t I? I’m sure they’ll ask about my family and what I’m doing nowadays, and I’ll have to give a whole spiel about how things are good and that I’ve been keeping busy—that kind of stuff.” “God, I’m just dreading the whole thing,” the president added. While conceding that he would almost inevitably encounter the populace and have no choice but to engage in a few minutes of strained conversation, the commander-in-chief said he planned to reduce such chance meetings by keeping his distance from those places where he knows the nation’s inhabitants frequently gather or at least by restricting his visits to times when they would be less likely to be around. Obama admitted, however, that if he did bump into the American people despite such precautions, he might simply pretend not to notice them. “Maybe I could just kind of wave at them from a distance and keep walking,” said Obama, noting that such a fleeting interaction might be enough to make the public feel acknowledged while also sparing him the lengthier back-and-forth he intensely hoped to avoid. “I feel like that’s the most I can handle right now. Seriously, just the thought of minding my own business at a gas station or wherever and suddenly finding myself in some excruciating chitchat with the general population is kind of a nightmare.” Despite his apprehension about encountering the American public, Obama acknowledged that it’s likely he could change his position at some point in the future, when things might possibly be “a little less weird.” “Sure, down the line, I could see us maybe chatting for a bit,” said Obama, who noted it might take another administration or two before he feels he could comfortably interact with the public again. “For now, though, I really want to just do my own separate thing and let the American people do their thing. No ill will at all. But come January 21, I guess I’m not really going to have all that much to say to them.” Added Obama, “Eight years is a long time, you know?”"
1629,"WASHINGTON—Saying he would be “sitting pretty” if he landed such a primo gig, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly decided Tuesday to leave off several of his most recent felonies while filling out a job application for a blackjack dealer position at the Horseshoe Casino Baltimore. “Listen, Uncle Joe is kind of behind the eight ball here, and in a couple days I won’t even have a pot to piss in—I sure as shit don’t need a pit boss hassling my ass about some completely bum charges I had thrown my way,” said Biden, who omitted convictions for check fraud and tax evasion from the form, as well as a “raw deal” arson rap from 2015, which the vice president explained was likely to be wiped from his record within the next few months if “Uncle Joe keeps his nose clean.” “The head honcho who gave me the paperwork seemed like a reasonable dude, so I doubt he’d give a rat’s ass about some of these charges. And there’s no way in hell anybody’s gonna find out about that whole mess down in Dover. That shit’s totally legal in half the other states.” Sources confirmed that Biden then listed the phone number and home address of his close friend Blaze when filling in the contact information for his parole officer."
1630,"WASHINGTON—In an effort to allay concerns over how the abrupt removal of Obamacare would impact millions covered by the legislation, House Republicans pledged Tuesday that they would not dismantle the healthcare law without first putting in place a detailed and comprehensive plan for disposing of patients’ disease-ridden corpses, sources confirmed. “We want the American people to know that we will not, under any circumstances, repeal the Affordable Care Act until we have a full, working Republican alternative for disposing of participants’ withered, virus-infested remains,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), adding that current enrollees can rest assured that the GOP is working tirelessly to draft provisions that will ensure every single Obamacare recipient can have their ashen and tumor-riddled carcass cremated, buried, or dissolved in a quick and efficient manner at minimal cost. “To those presently insured under the ACA, you can expect a smooth transition in the weeks ahead from your current coverage to our much cheaper, easier, and more convenient corpse-elimination plan. Your putrid lifeless body and the putrid lifeless bodies of your loved ones will be well taken care of—that’s our party’s guarantee to you.” McCarthy added that Americans will also be pleased to know that free-market competition will keep down the fees associated with the GOP’s plan, as all current Obamacare beneficiaries will soon have the option of having their moldering corpses disposed of across state lines."

1632,"NEW YORK—Paying tribute to the efforts of countless men and women who are united by their deep commitment to equality and justice for all people, President-elect Donald Trump spoke at a ceremony Monday honoring the sacrifices civil rights activists will have to make under his presidency. “Our nation owes a great deal to the brave activists and political organizers who will have to fight so hard for freedom and equal rights over the next four years,” Trump told assembled members of the press, explaining that civil rights leaders deserve particular commendation for standing up for what’s right in spite of the intense opposition, brutal crackdowns, and smear campaigns they will encounter from his administration. “So many Americans will make the selfless decision to put themselves in danger to defend basic freedoms for citizens of every color and creed. Some will be jailed for long periods, and some, tragically, will even lose their lives. Let us stop and consider the very real cruelty and inhumanity these incredible people will be enduring in the months and years ahead.” Trump then reportedly concluded his remarks with a reflection on how much the country will have changed over the course of his presidency."
1633,"WASHINGTON—Growing suddenly introspective as he flipped open his Whitesnake Zippo lighter in a West Wing hallway, Vice President Joe Biden reportedly came to the sad realization Monday that this could be the last time he tosses a lit firecracker into a White House press conference. “Aw shit, after today, I might never get another shot to whip an M80 into the Press Briefing Room again—end of an era, man, end of a goddamn era,” said Biden, who smiled wistfully while recalling all the “kickass” times he launched a handful of bottle rockets at the audience of unsuspecting “ink slingers.” “Back in the Senate, Orrin Hatch used to get his panties in a knot when I chucked a fat little cherry bomb under his seat. I shit you not, that fucker pissed himself more times than I could count. Don’t get me wrong, though, Ol’ Joe’s gonna keep on flinging bangers into crowds after I blow this joint, but hell, it’ll never be the same as this.” At press time, Biden was reportedly tying together the fuses of several firecrackers to give the press corps “something they’ll never fucking forget.”"

Plus, he’s one of the most respected figures in the Beltway.” Farber went on to say that Bo was also the most adorable little munchkin ever hired in the history of the firm."
1635,"PYONGYANG—Bursting into the North Korean dictator’s central control room to find his wife suspended from a rope 40 feet in the air, a frantic Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly looked on in horror Friday as Teresa Heinz was slowly lowered into Kim Jong-un’s electric eel tank. “Well, well, well, how nice of you to join us, Mr. Kerry—as you can see, I’m about to serve dinner, and my electrified little friends here are quite hungry,” said Kim, who ordered his henchmen to seize the U.S. cabinet official and make sure he had a close, unobstructed view of his beloved wife’s final moments. “You may have been able to escape my chamber of horrors, Mr. Kerry, but there is nothing you can do to help her now. A pity that such a lovely woman will have to suffer such a terrible fate, but you should have thought twice before challenging the mighty state of North Korea. You should bid her one last goodbye while you still have the chance.” According to sources, with Heinz just two feet away from reaching the tank’s surface, the North Korean leader exited the control room to check on the status of his latest nuclear device, leaving Kerry under the watch of only two guards."
1636,"WASHINGTON—Seeking to allay concerns about how the incoming commander-in-chief’s business ties would affect the way he governs, members of Donald Trump’s White House transition team assured the American public Friday that the president-elect has far too many conflicts of interest to favor any individual one. “The American people have absolutely nothing to worry about regarding Mr. Trump’s ethical integrity, as his conflicts of interest are simply too extensive for him to give preferential treatment to any one of them in particular,” said Trump senior advisor Kellyanne Conway, noting that the real estate magnate’s foreign and domestic holdings are so expansive and complex that it would be almost impossible for him to keep track of them all, let alone isolate one specifically and exploit it. “Every single citizen can rest assured that none of Mr. Trump’s vast array of investments will ever take precedence over any of the others. And even if one of his many business interests did stand to sway his position on an issue, another one of the thousands of other ventures he has a stake in would surely exert pressure to counteract it. So there’s no reason for concern at all.” Conway added that given how committed every member of the incoming administration was to upholding such rigorous principles, the American populace should not even waste their time by scrutinizing the White House’s ethics at all for the next four years."

If this is the lifestyle these deviant animals seek to pursue, then they should do so without the help of any taxpayer dollars.” Pence admitted, however, that he might not slash funding completely, noting that he approved of the fact that elk typically copulate only a few weeks out of the year and then go about a life of complete chastity in between."

Under our plan, you can still have lymphoma. You could even expand on that into other forms of cancer.

1656,"CEDAR PLAINS, PA—After years of delays and mounting criticism from voters and political pundits, President Barack Obama finally followed through on a campaign promise he made in 2008 to spend one night alone in the abandoned Cedar Plains Family Fun amusement park, sources confirmed Wednesday. At approximately 6 p.m. last night, members of the press reportedly looked on as Obama—carrying only a flashlight, a water bottle, and a backpack full of snacks—scaled the 9-foot-high chain-link fence and entered the derelict theme park, making good on a vow that had been a central component of his initial run for the White House. “Eight years ago, I made an oath that if I were elected president, I would spend dusk till dawn in this old, run-down amusement park, and tonight I am fulfilling my obligation to the American people,” said Obama, who had been widely accused of favoring other legislative priorities above an overnight stay inside the dilapidated regional attraction that shut its doors in 2003. “Between now and sunrise, I will climb to the top of the Ripsaw roller coaster, I will throw a rock through the window of the snow cone stand, and just as I’ve said time and time again, I will wander around in the big concrete track where the Lazy River used to be.” “And to prove that I do not take your support for granted, I will also walk through the Hall of Mirrors at midnight,” Obama added. Since first raising the issue during the 2008 primaries, Obama’s promise to spend at least 12 hours unaccompanied within the overgrown park grounds has been a focal point of his domestic policy. Throughout the general election, his repeated vows to climb down into the basin under the Gopher’s Gulch log flume and spend 10 minutes inside one of the rusted cars on the Ferris wheel became fixtures of his stump speeches and TV ads, characterizing the young Illinois senator as the only candidate willing to brave the eerily barren park in the dead of night. However, with the pledge still unfulfilled after Obama’s first 100 days in office, activists began protesting outside the White House regularly, demanding to know when the president would finally put on a thick coat, walk across the property’s cracked parking lot to the padlocked gates, and implement his much-discussed plan to stroll down Cedar Plains’ debris-strewn midway under the light of a full moon. “At a time of great strife when Americans were looking for something to rally around, Obama united the country by swearing that one of his top goals would be to crawl under the wooden barricades and investigate the park’s old food court,” said political analyst Mark Halperin, noting that Obama built momentum around his candidacy and attracted sizable political donations whenever he mentioned the possibility of finding old funnel cake and cotton candy machines that had gone unused for years. “So perhaps it was inevitable that there would be backlash when Obama’s first two years elapsed without him providing even a basic outline of how he would break into the amusement park or a list of which of the decrepit rides he would see if he could turn back on.” “Frankly, he got lucky when the bin Laden raid took everyone’s attention away, or else he may not have been reelected,” Halperin added. In an effort to help secure his presidential legacy, Obama returned to his campaign pledge earlier this year, announcing to the nation during his State of the Union address that he had purchased a sleeping bag in anticipation of spending a night in the park, and later telling graduates in a speech at Howard University that before he left office, he would do everything in his power to take a picture from inside the Gravitron to show people what it looked like in there now. “I was really impressed with Obama when he was first running because he seemed like the only candidate who actually had the will and the temperament to spend the whole night in a spooky boarded-up amusement park,” said Kansas City, MO resident Angie Hartney, noting that the then-senator’s claim was one of the primary reasons she supported him in 2008. “I still think he should’ve done this back in his first term, but after all the compromises and excuses—and it seeming like he’d never actually go down into the underground storage rooms where they supposedly keep some of the old bumper cars—it’s great to know he still has the power to inspire people.” “That’s the Obama I voted for,” added Hartney. At press time, the president’s approval rating had risen to an all-time high as an exhausted but triumphant Obama emerged from the park holding a tattered stuffed animal from the shuttered ring toss stand."

We simply did not see this unprecedented turnout from voters’ adrenal medullas coming. In the future, however, we’ll use simple blood tests to check the adrenaline and cortisol levels in all our polling participants to make sure we don’t get blindsided by something like this again.” Patti noted that, on the other hand, pollsters had done an excellent job of predicting the record-low serotonin levels among this year’s voters."

1674,"WASHINGTON—Following Donald Trump’s stunning victory in the general election early Wednesday morning, political experts confirmed that conditions in the United States are now finally as bad as the Republican nominee has long claimed. “Though we had previously been able to dismiss Trump’s proclamations as mere hyperbole and scare tactics, the United States now definitively meets the criteria of being the declining superpower that Trump has described for the past 17 months,” said Georgetown University political science professor Ronald Leidecker, adding that, as of tonight, the nation no longer commands the same respect among world powers it once did, and our country’s greatest days most definitely lie in its past, just as the Republican has asserted. “Our economy is, since about 10 p.m yesterday, on the verge of collapse, and when it comes to foreign relations, we have foolishly made ourselves vulnerable on multiple fronts, putting the very existence of everything our nation holds dear at risk. In the words of Donald Trump, our country is a disaster.” Once again echoing the pronouncements of president-elect Trump, Leidecker noted that we sadly won’t be able to rely on Washington to change anything, as our political system is largely run by self-serving, power-hungry factionalists who don’t have the best interests of common Americans at heart."
1675,"SAND SPRINGS, OK—Feeling a mixture of intense pride and abject disbelief after news networks called the 2016 presidential election in favor of Donald Trump, local man Terry Williams, who is currently wearing a T-shirt adorned with the word “Jewmerica,” told reporters late Tuesday night that he never dreamed he’d see this day during his lifetime. “This is so incredible—not in a million years did I think I’d ever get to watch a historic moment like this,” said the unemployed 43-year-old, who has worn the T-shirt featuring the Star of David overlaid atop the United States flag throughout the 2016 election season as he closely followed Trump’s campaign for the presidency and encouraged voters like him to head to the polls by writing regular posts on white nationalist forums. “I won’t forget this feeling as long as I live. I’m so happy I might cry. Honestly, I’ve never been more proud to call myself an American.” At press time, a visibly elated Williams was reportedly searching for his “Trump That Bitch” hat to wear while watching Hillary Clinton’s concession speech."
1676,"WASHINGTON—Political experts are hailing Donald Trump’s historic presidential victory early Wednesday as a resounding declaration that the nation is finally ready to cast off the tyrannical yoke of moderate respect for women that has suffocated the citizens of this country for generations. “Under Trump’s presidency, we can now look ahead to a bold new era in America in which we will no longer suffer under a repressive ideology that demands basic decency and relatively equal treatment toward half the nation’s population,” said Harvard political science professor Gregory Nagle, adding that citizens could now live free from the fear that they would never again be lightly chastised for making derogatory comments about a woman’s appearance or implying that women are less capable or intelligent than men. “For far too long, Americans have been at the mercy of an authoritarian belief system that sometimes presses employers to consider hiring women for high-level positions and, under certain circumstances, allows women to have control over their own bodies. And faced with the unsavory prospect of women receiving fair pay or having their sexual assault claims taken seriously, Americans went to the polls today and made their voices heard loud and clear. This is a bright new day for America.” In a similar finding, political scientists asserted that Trump’s election also represented a decisive move by the people of this country to shake off the brutal fetters of half-hearted attempts at racial tolerance."
1677,"WASHINGTON—Shattering a barrier long thought unbreakable in the United States, Donald Trump, the 70-year-old billionaire real estate mogul from New York, became the first black-hearted man in history to win the American presidency, in the early hours of Wednesday morning. President-elect Trump, who in July became the first black-hearted nominee of a major political party, once again rewrote the history books as the first black-hearted man to capture the majority of votes in the electoral college, defeating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in a closely contested race. The once unimaginable outcome of a black-hearted man assuming the role of commander-in-chief of the United States has already sent major shockwaves through the nation and, indeed, across the world. “Honestly, I’m in shock—I cannot believe that we just elected a black-hearted man as president,” said Stephen Payton, 49, of Greensboro, NC, adding that just the thought of a black-hearted man sitting in the Oval Office “sent chills down [his] spine.” “Frankly, I never thought I’d live to see us put a man like that in the White House, but I guess times do change. Our nation is clearly moving in a new direction.” “It just goes to show you that anything is possible in America,” he continued. Trump’s victory, which defied the long-held conventional wisdom about the prospects of black-hearted candidates, has been described as a watershed moment for the nation’s millions of black-hearted Americans whose overwhelming support buoyed his run for the presidency. Encouraged by the possibility of one of their own occupying the highest seat of power in the nation, black-hearted Americans reportedly turned out in record numbers in all 50 states, propelling Trump to a historic victory. Perhaps most critically, early analysis indicates that Trump’s win may have been sealed by his ability to capture the votes of millions of Americans who were long assumed to be incapable of ever voting for a black-hearted candidate. “Having someone who is black-hearted running the country is definitely going to change everything,” said Samantha Davis, 56, of Tacoma, WA, who explained that she expects Trump to govern in accordance with the values and beliefs shaped by his formative years growing up as a young black-hearted man in New York City. “There’s no way he’s going to be like any of the other men who came before him. He’s proud to be a black-hearted man because that’s exactly who he is.” “And that won’t change just because he’s the president,” she added. While no official announcements have been made, Washington insiders believe that Trump is also expected to name black-hearted Americans to fill key cabinet positions, with sources identifying former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani as likely choices for top roles. Reflecting on the historic nature of the evening and what it may mean for the future, many have described Trump’s election as perhaps the single greatest achievement in black-hearted history. “Oh my God, he actually won!” said Kyle Leigh, 27, of Watertown, NY, before pausing and breaking down in tears after learning that a black-hearted man will now occupy the White House for the next four or eight years. “This really happened. It’s just starting to sink in.” “Nothing is going to be the same after this election,” he added. “Nothing.”"
1678,"WASHINGTON—Saying their rosy attitude about the state of the election was not helping anything given what is currently transpiring, sources confirmed Tuesday night that the nation’s optimists need to seriously shut the fuck up as soon as humanly fucking possible. “Sure, things may look bad right now, but even if the worst happens, it’s only four years we’re talking about here,” said Santa Fe, NM resident Pete Mirenge, one of hundreds of thousands of positive thinkers across the nation who would do everyone a huge goddamn favor by closing their fucking traps right this fucking second and keeping them sealed for the foreseeable future. “This is exactly why we have a system of checks and balances—to ensure that whatever happens in the election, the executive branch never gets too much power. Think about it: Has any president been able to carry out their platform to the letter? No. Nothing’s ever as bad as it seems, believe me.” According to sources, a calm and composed Mirenge—who reportedly has about five seconds before his mouth is shut for him—then added that the country’s been through much worse and everything turned out okay."
1679,"NEW YORK—Roughly two hours into the network’s live nine-hour-long “Election Night In America” programming block, CNN anchor Anderson Cooper informed viewers Tuesday evening he is only moments away from delivering the first piece of genuinely significant information of the day. “Folks, you’ll want to stay with us, because it’s only a matter of minutes before we show you today’s first meaningful, truly pertinent election update,” said Cooper, adding that as early as 7:30 p.m. EST, the network would be reporting some legitimately consequential news that would actually make CNN’s election broadcast worth watching. “Stay with us here on CNN for continuing election coverage, because you won’t want to miss it when we provide a development of actual consequence. Until then, we’ll send it over to John King.” After Cooper eventually revealed some concrete information on early returns in New Hampshire, CNN reportedly placed a 30-minute countdown clock on the side of the screen that displayed how long it would be until the network breaks the next piece of even remotely noteworthy election news."
1680,"NEW YORK—Marking the joyous occasion with singing, dancing, and a chorus of ecstatic cheers, an estimated 2 million citizens gathered beneath the Times Square countdown clock Tuesday night to celebrate the end of the 2016 election season, sources reported. The crowd of revelers—many of whom had arrived in the early morning to stake out prime viewing locations—reportedly swelled in volume throughout the night, spilling over into nearby streets as many popped bottles of champagne, embraced loved ones, and finally joined together in a boisterous countdown seconds before the polls were scheduled to close. “God, this is so amazing,” said local man Mark Edwards, gazing up at a fireworks display signaling the conclusion of the incessant media coverage, debates, stump speeches, and campaign advertisements of the election cycle. “I can’t even begin to describe how excited everyone is here. It’s really unbelievable.” “Wooooo!” he shouted, his voice nearly drowned out by the sound of Kool & The Gang’s “Celebration” emanating from loudspeakers situated on buildings around the square. According to witnesses, the scene was one of unbridled merriment, with roars of delight sweeping through the crowd every time the enormous LED screens in Times Square showed that voting had ended in another state. As vote totals began to come in, thousands in attendance reportedly raised their arms in jubilation, unfurled homemade banners, or placed calls to family members, often yelling to be heard over the sound of whistles, noisemakers, and the exuberant din of the crowd. Throughout the night’s revelry, celebrants were also seen craning their necks and hoisting children onto their shoulders to view the One Times Square Astrovision screen displaying live feeds of equally raucous celebrations in downtown Los Angeles, Chicago’s Loop, Miami Beach, Market Square Park in Houston, and other locations throughout the country “We stood out in the cold all day to get a good spot, but what’s a few extra hours of discomfort when you’ve been looking forward to this for so long?” said Alice Castillo, who told reporters she had driven there from Baltimore with her two daughters to be part of the excitement. “Could we have stayed home and watched it all on TV? Of course. But nothing compares to the thrill of sharing this incredible moment with so many other people.” “When the clock struck zero and everyone erupted into cheers, it was pretty magical,” Castillo added. While the crowd was said to have thinned after the polls closed along the East Coast, a reported 250,000 remained well into the night to take in the joyful atmosphere and pack the area’s overflowing bars. One of the Times Square celebrants, 36-year-old Brett Cleaver, said the night’s festivities had caused him to reflect on the past year and consider how tonight represented a fresh start. “Beginning tomorrow, I’m going to try to cherish every second I have where I don’t hear the phrase ‘swing state’ or see footage from a campaign rally,” Cleaver told reporters, beaming at the prospect of never again looking at an article that speculated on how undecided voters would react to Donald Trump’s or Hillary Clinton’s latest statements. “For tonight, though, I’m just soaking up as much of this moment as I can.” Added Cleaver, “I’m already excited to come back and do this again in 2020.”"
1681,"INDIANAPOLIS—His stomach reportedly sinking immediately after he entered the line at his polling place and caught sight of the complete oaf sitting behind the volunteer table, local voter Steven Wu confirmed Tuesday that he was dreading being sent over to a visibly stupid election worker to receive his ballot. “Oh God, look at this dummy—they better not point me toward him,” said Wu, who grew increasingly nervous as he moved up in line and witnessed the slow-moving and slow-witted moron apologize to several voters in a row after mistaking a stack of provisional ballots for regular ballots and subsequently knocking a container of markers onto the floor. “Ugh. Now he’s saying he locked himself out of the computer that has all the voters’ names in it. Jesus Christ, this guy’s as dumb as a post.” At press time, Wu was silently cursing to himself as the spectacular dumbfuck got up to ask the polling place’s most competent volunteer for help."
1682,"RICHMOND, VA—Pulling the cheddar-flavored snacks from his right pants pocket, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine reportedly crammed a fistful of Goldfish crackers into one of his voting precinct’s ballot scanners Tuesday. “You look hungry,” said Kaine, who enthusiastically mashed the fish-shaped crackers into the scanner’s ballot feed slot before inserting a juice box straw into the opening and squirting fruit punch into the device. “There you go, Mr. Machine. Hope you liked your num nums!” At press time, Kaine had reportedly inserted ballot marking pens into each nostril and slid across the floor while barking like a walrus."

After it was officially projected that Donald Trump would take the critical swing state of Ohio and its 18 electoral votes, vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine quickly ran over to a visibly disappointed Hillary Clinton and attempted to lift her spirits by pulling his shirt up above his midriff and showing her his belly button. The Virginia senator spent several minutes holding up the bottom of his shirt with his chin while repeatedly pointing at his navel and informing Clinton that he has “a innie [sic],” prompting Clinton to curtly nod and say “Yes, that’s right,” before craning her neck to look past him at the electoral map to track her progress in Florida and Nevada.

Secretary Clinton could be seen weaving between cars in Manhattan, driving on the sidewalk to get past several areas of heavy traffic, and then accelerating to speeds in excess of 110 miles per hour once she reached the interstate. Reporters were unable to keep up with the Democratic nominee, but numerous witnesses confirmed that Clinton had a baseball bat stowed next to her and appeared incredibly irate before she pulled down the tinted visor on her helmet, revved the motorcycle’s engine, and tore away.

NEW YORK—Briskly striding into frame and interrupting a jubilant family meal, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer reportedly entered the middle of an Olive Garden commercial airing during the network’s election coverage Tuesday night to announce a late-breaking election result. “Breaking news: CNN is calling Nevada for Hillary Clinton,” said Blitzer, stepping directly in front of a smiling mother passing a heaping plate of fettucine alfredo to her daughter and shushing the laughter of surrounding tables so that he could add that the victory dealt a severe blow to Donald Trump’s chances of reaching the Oval Office. “We are projecting that Secretary Clinton will take the crucial swing state’s six electoral votes, putting her on the inside track to securing the 270 electoral votes needed—hey, excuse me, will you please keep it down?—needed to win the presidency.” At press time, Blitzer was ducking in panic as the Olive Garden logo came swooping into frame. WASHINGTON—After emerging victorious from one of the most pivotal elections in history, president-elect Barack Obama will assume the role of commander in chief on Jan. 20, shattering a racial barrier the United States is, at long last, shitty enough to overcome. Although polls going into the final weeks of October showed Sen. Obama in the lead, it remained unclear whether the failing economy, dilapidated housing market, crumbling national infrastructure, health care crisis, energy crisis, and five-year-long disastrous war in Iraq had made the nation crappy enough to rise above 300 years of racial prejudice and make lasting change. “Today the American people have made their voices heard, and they have said, ‘Things are finally as terrible as we’re willing to tolerate,” said Obama, addressing a crowd of unemployed, uninsured, and debt-ridden supporters. “To elect a black man, in this country, and at this time—these last eight years must have really broken you.” Added Obama, “It’s a great day for our nation.” READ FULL ARTICLE As results continue to come in,The Onionis projecting a decisive win for Donald Trump in New Hampshire, no matter what the mainstream liberal media will try to lead you to believe. The real polls that we saw just a few days ago showed Trump leading the state by as many as nine points, but of course those numbers were DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED by elite-controlled left-wing media outlets likeThe New York TimesandWashington Postin order to push their BLATANT and DANGEROUS pro-Clinton agenda. So while you’re watching some leftist establishment “news” show on CNN call New Hampshire for a CRIMINAL, just remember that we’re the only ones willing to tell We the People the TRUTH about this election’s results. With polls now closed in the state,The Onionprojects that Hillary Clinton will take Illinois, which, if you’d been paying any attention to what we’ve been saying all along, you would’ve known was going to happen. Seriously, you better not be surprised about this, because we’ve been telling everyone from the beginning—literally from the very beginning—that Clinton was going to take these 20 electoral votes. Christ, we should’ve just put this damn graphic up months ago and saved ourselves all the time and effort, for crying out loud. Hoooo-weee!The Oniongon’ come right out and pro-ject Bubba, the biggest, meanest, most confounding-est catfish in the Mississip’, to take the whole of Missourah.

Must be long enough to measure the whole length of the Big Muddy itself, we’d wager. A’course, heaps of folks gon’ ’round saying Bubba and all the fishin’ boats he done capsized is just a bit of fanciful tale-telling to rile up the young’uns ’fore they sent off to sleepin’. But now it does appear that the Catfish Devil of the Mississipp’ hisself is ready to grab up the Show Me State and all 10 of its ee-leck-toral votes right into his big ol’ grinnin’ jaws.

After dumping the few remnants of the 1,000-count box into his open mouth shortly after Virginia was called for Secretary Clinton, the Indiana governor could be seen brushing aside the pile of sacramental bread crumbs gathered on his chest before tossing the empty carton across the room and calling on an aide to bring him another. Onion political correspondent Lyndsey Mishek is reporting live from Trump HQ in New York City throughout the evening. According to early exit polls in states across the East Coast and Midwest, a record number of voters are shitting their pants in sheer fucking terror after casting their ballot. Our statistical models predicted a significant turnout among Americans who are freaking the fuck out right now, but the data are revealing a much stronger showing than we originally projected, and it still remains to be seen what effect the absolutely-fucking-petrified vote will have on the election’s outcome. We can also confidently say that polling places in all 50 states have seen a historically low number of voters who are still capable of feeling optimism about anything. Jake Hewitt is the founder and editor-in-chief of the Ballot Measure, which focuses on polling analysis and statistical forecasting for The Onion. It’s still too early to call the election either way, but one thing appears clear tonight: Vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine is doing an excellent job of identifying the colors on the electoral map. Kaine just pointed to Illinois on the live map and yelled “Blue!” before smiling widely and clapping his hands, having already correctly pointed out that Texas and Oklahoma are red “just like fire trucks.” The Virginia senator was said to have annoyed numerous top-level staffers, however, by repeatedly and excitedly shouting that Michigan remains gray. UPDATE: Kaine is currently struggling to remember all the numbers from 1 to 50 while counting the states on the map.

The mood is extremely positive here at the Blue Valley North High School gymnasium in Leawood, KS, where excited local voters are pouring into their respective locker rooms to hit the showers after successfully casting their ballots. Shouts of joy and congratulations are emanating from the men’s and women’s locker rooms as celebratory citizens high-five one another and slap each other on the back for their excellent performance in the voting booth. Reports also indicate that a number of the precinct’s more rowdy residents are snapping towels at first-time voters’ exposed backsides. Compiled from reports out of The Onion’s Leawood, KS bureau as part of our Precinct Watch initiative, dedicated to covering all voting rights obstacles encountered by the feckless and feeble-minded American electorate. With 4 percent of precincts reporting,The Onionis ready to call the state of Ohio and its 18 electoral votes for whoever offers us the highest bid. The key swing state, whichThe Onionprojects could tip the election one way or the other, would be an extremely valuable pickup for any candidate willing to open their purse and make us a solid proposal. The Buckeye State would be perfect for a candidate looking to get to 270 votes, or it could be a nice addition that pads a candidate’s margin of victory and provides them with a clear mandate from the people.

Based on observations made throughout the evening, it appears that Donald and Melania Trump’s 10-year-old son, Barron, is carefully cataloging all of tonight’s events so they can one day be dealt with by a trained mental health professional in future therapy sessions. Barron has been seen on numerous occasions sitting quietly and closely watching as his father berates staffers and other watch party attendees whenever a new batch of voting data isn’t to his liking, listening intently to top-level aides angrily discussing whether “too many” blacks showed up at the polls in North Carolina, and carefully following the comments made by his father’s supporters on Twitter, almost certainly for the purpose of keeping each of these moments clearly in mind so that they can be worked through with a therapist in several years. It also appears that Barron senses there may be something big for him and his eventual psychoanalyst to spend a considerable amount of time discussing, as he’s now positioned himself at the foot of the dais for when the race gets called.

The excitement is palpable at the North Fire Station polling place in Sausalito, CA for one local 30-year-old voter, who is thrilled to be casting her ballot right next to the big red fire trucks. Resident Kate Durham, a graphic designer and fully grown woman, was seen smiling broadly as she waited in line next to three massive fire engines, where she was able to get a close-up look at the truck’s large ladders, red lights, and the valves where the hoses connect. The woman, who is now in her fourth decade of life, was also overheard enthusiastically remarking to the person behind her how incredible it is that they “get to walk around inside here” before staring intently at the fire pole in the middle of the room.

Our correspondents are confirming a huge turnout outside the 22nd Street polling station in Reno, NV, as hundreds of voters stand in lines wrapping around the block to get into Mickey’s Burger Shack next door. Several exasperated individuals at the scene said they had to wait over three hours before placing their order. Additional reports suggest that many of those in line are growing irritable, especially following rumors that the shake machine broke. However, most seem undeterred, claiming that they could never forgive themselves if they missed out on participating in the historic two-for-Tuesday double bacon cheeseburger deal.

Just to be sure we don’t forget about this,The Onionis going to go ahead and call California for Hillary Clinton right now; that way, we won’t have to worry about it later. There’s going to be a lot going on tonight and a bunch of other states that we’ll be keeping track of pretty closely, and to be honest, this one might slip our mind. So, let’s just get a jump on things and officially announce that with zero precincts reporting, we are able to state that California’s 55 electoral votes will go to Clinton. Oh, and while we’re at it:The Onionprojects that Gary Johnson will finish the night with zero electoral votes. Good to get that out of the way too. In a completely unexpected late development, experts from Quinnipiac and Suffolk have projected Bill Clinton to live through election night. While some skepticism exists in certain corners that the former president will still be breathing by tomorrow morning, the sources I spoke to seemed confident that his major organs should continue functioning normally through at least the next 12 to 16 hours. But as we all know, anything can happen on Election Day. UPDATE: Bill Clinton remains alive and appears to be fully conscious. Onion chief political correspondent Martin Hazelton is reporting live from Clinton HQ in New York City throughout the evening. The mood has grown tense here at Trump headquarters, as campaign strategist Mike Rubino began loudly screaming at the Republican nominee that there was “no fucking chance” that Vermont’s election results were rigged. Witnesses confirmed that Rubino had grown increasingly exasperated at Trump’s unwillingness to accept that voters may have selected Hillary Clinton of their own accord, at one point demanding that Trump stop immediately uttering the word “rigged” aloud every time he was informed another state had gone to his opponent. The last straw appeared to be when Trump argued that Clinton winning Vermont, a state with three electoral votes that hasn’t gone for a Republican since 1988, was proof of a widespread conspiracy against him. In response, Rubino was heard shouting, “Shut up! Shut the fuck up! There’s absolutely no fucking way you’d ever win Vermont, Donald! You won’t find one goddamn poll in the world that even puts you in the fucking ballpark. I mean, Vermont? Who the fuck do you think you are? No one fucking likes you there—it’s fucking Vermont! Jesus fucking Christ. And you know what else? None of the other ones are rigged either! There, I said it. Maryland isn’t rigged. Massachusetts isn’t rigged. And guess what? Neither is Pennsylvania! God, you’re such a sack of shit!” Upon noticing that the rest of the ballroom had gone silent and everyone was staring at him, Rubino paused, quietly apologized, and sat back down at his laptop, at which time he was grabbed by two security officials and escorted out of the New York Hilton Midtown.

With nearly all the man’s deepest emotions now reporting,The Onionis projecting that Hillary Clinton has won the heart of 46-year-old Derek Mumkin of Muncie, IN. According toThe Onion’s electoral models, Clinton overcame long odds to take the local electrical worker’s affections, securing a higher-than-anticipated number of his hopes and desires, and performing particularly strongly with his sense of possibility. With the decisive victory, Clinton adds the divorced father of two’s 0.000001662 electoral votes to her total, partially counteracting Trump’s recent wins with both of Mumkin’s ex-wives. In a late-breaking development here at Trump headquarters, campaign aides have just thrown an old blanket over the cage of former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani. The hope, as we’ve heard, is that covering Giuliani’s enclosure will help quiet down the campaign surrogate, who became extremely agitated at the mention of Hillary Clinton’s name on one of the television broadcasts and disrupted the entire election watch party by frantically screeching and banging his head against the cage’s metal bars. If this effort fails to silence the politician, the campaign is considering relocating Giuliani to the Trump Tower basement for the remainder of the night.

Our correspondents are reporting a steady turnout of homely and hideous residents throughout the suburban Philadelphia area that shows no signs of slowing down. In Montgomery County, polling places are said to be bustling with scores of schlubby, overweight voters, while Bucks and Delaware counties were reportedly busy all morning with an influx of unsightly, poorly groomed constituents, with many of the local oinkers having to wait upwards of an hour in line to cast their ballot. Overall, turnout in the area appears to be way uglier than analysts initially predicted.

With several hours still remaining before the first polls close, reports coming in from across the nation have confirmed that this election has already seen a record number of voters have their hands torn off by ballot machines. As of this moment, an estimated 35,000 Americans have lost fingers, hands, or entire limbs today while attempting to feed their ballot into their polling place’s scanner, which compares to just 27,000 cases in the entire 2012 election. Since this morning, I’ve personally witnessed three people get caught in the machine and have their arm ripped off at the elbow. Luckily, in each case, polling attendants were able to quickly unclog the machine and get things moving again with little delay.

SALT LAKE CITY—Inquiring about several potential scenarios, Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson reportedly asked his campaign aides what their best path to 270 electoral votes was while they were in the midst of packing up the candidate’s headquarters Tuesday. “Okay, let’s think through the electoral map and see where our clearest shot at victory is,” said Johnson to top advisors who were taping shut cardboard boxes containing unsold campaign T-shirts, bumper stickers, and buttons reading “#LetGaryDebate.” “Have we gained any traction in Florida? That would give us a lot more wiggle room in New Hampshire and North Carolina. And if we got a strong early turnout in Alaska and South Dakota, that definitely moves us a lot closer to 270, if not beyond.” At press time, Johnson was muttering to himself about the western Mountain states in an empty office as his campaign staff went out back and threw everything into the dumpster. As unfavorable returns continue to come in, the mood here at Trump headquarters has become more subdued, with campaign staffers trying their best to seem busy and keep as much distance as they can between themselves and the candidate in the event he needs to be comforted. Aides are anticipating that if several crucial swing states don’t go the Republican nominee’s way in the next hour, Trump might very well become visibly sad, a prospect that has already prompted most of them to begin avoiding eye contact with him and retreating to remote corners of the Hilton ballroom. Just moments ago, after Hillary Clinton’s lead in Pennsylvania grew to 3 percentage points, Trump reportedly emitted an audible sigh, prompting everyone within earshot to briskly stride toward the restrooms. Onion political correspondent Lyndsey Mishek is reporting live from Trump HQ in New York City throughout the evening. Hillary Clinton has done her best tonight to appear enthusiastic and full of energy, but it’s clear that the chaos of Election Day has begun to take its toll. Minutes ago, I witnessed her step away from her election watch party here in midtown Manhattan in order to relax and decompress by carefully reviewing the U.S. federal tax code. Clinton is said to be, at present, calming her nerves by lounging in a private room away from the crowds where she can sit back and quietly page through Section 1551 regarding the disallowance of the benefits of the graduated corporate rates and the accumulated earnings credit. UPDATE: After an aide informed her that she needs to get back to the watch party, Clinton reportedly used a napkin to mark the page where she left off in “Chapter 6: Consolidated Returns” before returning to the rest of her staff. Onion chief political correspondent Martin Hazelton is reporting live from Clinton HQ in New York City throughout the evening. Using a linear regression model that augmented the available data from both national polls and state-level surveys, the Ballot Measure electoral model clearly shows that Montana isn’t worth jack shit in this election and that you shouldn’t give the slightest fuck about it one way or the other. Statistical trends over the past four elections already suggested that this worthless expanse was about as fucking meaningless as a state could get, but with incoming exit polls and early voting data, it’s now obvious that MT can go suck a fat one, because its three paltry electoral votes sure as shit don’t matter one way or the other.

Heading into this election, there was a considerable amount of speculation and concern about what voting conditions would be like on Election Day, and at least one Donald Trump supporter here in Charlotte, NC has complained about the very short lines he’s seeing at this inner-city polling place. This echoes reports we’ve been hearing from perturbed and alarmed Trump supporters throughout the nation’s urban areas who are confirming wait times as short as 15 minutes at polling locations that serve mostly minorities. Many of these individuals have reportedly placed calls to their local Trump field offices in hopes of finding a quick remedy to the issue.

INDIANAPOLIS—His stomach reportedly sinking immediately after he entered the line at his polling place and caught sight of the complete oaf sitting behind the volunteer table, local voter Steven Wu confirmed Tuesday that he was dreading being sent over to a visibly stupid election worker to receive his ballot. “Oh God, look at this dummy—they better not point me toward him,” said Wu, who grew increasingly nervous as he moved up in line and witnessed the slow-moving and slow-witted moron apologize to several voters in a row after mistaking a stack of provisional ballots for regular ballots and subsequently knocking a container of markers onto the floor. “Ugh. Now he’s saying he locked himself out of the computer that has all the voters’ names in it. Jesus Christ, this guy’s as dumb as a post.” At press time, Wu was silently cursing to himself as the spectacular dumbfuck got up to ask the polling place’s most competent volunteer for help. Jesus fucking Christ, we’ve circled this stupid block, like, four times now looking for this goddamn church. They said the polling station is 214 East Washington. This is East Washington Street, right? God, we’ve been driving around looking for this place for a frigging hour now. Wait, is that it? No, shit! That’s the fucking Lutheran church again.

CHICAGO—Following a turbulent first term in office and one of the tightest and most-hard-fought presidential campaigns in recent history, a wholly and utterly defeated man emerged victorious Tuesday, winning reelection with 332 electoral votes. The shell of a man, who won 26 states and lost all hope in the American people, was able to secure victory with 50.6 percent of the popular vote, narrowly holding off a spirited challenge from Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Shortly after 11:00 p.m. Eastern time, upon prevailing in the key battleground state of Ohio, major media outlets declared the thoroughly beaten man’s victory. An hour later, the triumphant defeated man took the stage in Chicago’s McCormick Place convention center to the cheers of more than 10,000 supporters.

No, dignity? Is that one? God, I’m totally screwed.” At press time, Patterson had completely panicked and filled out the rest of her ballot randomly. As we’ve been continuously updating the Ballot Measure electoral projection model with live returns, we realized that we haven’t heard any polling data from North Dakota for about three weeks now, and we’re starting to worry about them.

WASHINGTON—African-American man Barack Obama, 47, was given the least-desirable job in the entire country Tuesday when he was elected president of the United States of America. In his new high-stress, low-reward position, Obama will be charged with such tasks as completely overhauling the nation’s broken-down economy, repairing the crumbling infrastructure, and generally having to please more than 300 million Americans and cater to their every whim on a daily basis. As part of his duties, the black man will have to spend four to eight years cleaning up the messes other people left behind. The job comes with such intense scrutiny and so certain a guarantee of failure that only one other person even bothered applying for it. Said scholar and activist Mark L. Denton, “It just goes to show you that, in this country, a black man still can’t catch a break.” SEE FULL ARTICLE Before America votes,The Onionoffers a refresher on the candidates’ differing platforms on the biggest issues facing our nation, including immigration: America’s Finest News Source compared the 2016 presidential candidates on the key positions that their advisors and focus group coordinators decided they hold.

From my seat of power behind this plastic folding table, I rule over all I survey, a domain that stretches from the double-door entrance of the Harker Middle School gymnasium to the pushed-in rows of bleachers at the back. Everything bathed by the harsh fluorescent lights gleaming from above is mine, for I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Keeper of the Voter Registry Printout and the Giver of “I Voted” Stickers. All who live between Maple Rose Avenue and Tenby Terrace and are eligible to vote must count themselves as my subjects. Do not dare question me! From the time you pass the Harker Wildcats logo on the baseline until you exit through the door by the boys’ locker room after submitting your ballot, my word is law. I am all-powerful, I am almighty, and I alone hold sway over everyone and everything in this kingdom. Unless your last name begins with a letter between L and Z. In that case, Carol will be assisting you. READ FULL ARTICLE Some very good news for Hillary Clinton out of New Jersey: She’s already jumped ahead to a 22-point lead among absentee voters based on all the mail-in ballots I’ve intercepted and opened thus far. HRC was always favored to win the historically blue Garden State, but based on my personal count of absentee ballots that I stole from post offices in Hoboken, Woodbridge, and Paterson, she is projected to take NJ with 57.26% of the vote—just 1.12 percentage points less than Barack Obama in 2012. In fact, using the random sampling of thousands of absentee ballots I took out of mailboxes last week across the state—each of which I tallied and then burned—HRC could theoretically take NJ’s 14 electoral votes by the largest margin for a Democratic nominee since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964.

WASHINGTON, DC—The economically disadvantaged segment of the U.S. population provided the decisive factor in another presidential election last Tuesday, handing control of the government to the rich and powerful once again. “The Republican party—the party of industrial mega-capitalists, corporate financiers, power brokers, and the moneyed elite—would like to thank the undereducated rural poor, the struggling blue-collar workers in Middle America, and the God-fearing underpriviledged minorities who voted George W. Bush back into office,” Karl Rove, senior advisor to Bush, told reporters at a press conference Monday. “You have selflessly sacrificed your well-being and voted against your own economic interest.

Frustration and tensions are running high at a Kearney, NE polling place, as many local residents have been waiting for over two hours in a long, slow-moving line to threaten the precinct’s only Hispanic voter. Though many have expressed concern that they won’t get a chance to question the voter about his citizenship or spread false information about ID requirements before the polls close, each person in line seems to be committed to waiting it out.

It looks increasingly likely that a low-pressure system, which has left much of the Midwest overcast and is so reminiscent of that cold, blustery day last December when you and Karen looked into each other’s eyes and finally agreed it was over, could significantly depress voter turnout in many states. Early returns in Missouri and Iowa have already shown that low temperatures, a high wind chill, and scattered showers will no doubt take you back to that horrible evening when, after yet another screaming match in the kitchen over the goddamn mortgage, Karen looked up at you—God, that tired look on her face will be burned into your memory forever—and she just muttered, “I can’t do this anymore.” And deep down, you knew you couldn’t either. This wasn’t normal. This wasn’t healthy. And it damn sure wasn’t the type of environment to raise a child in. So that was it: 12 years of marriage down the drain, right then and there.

Hundreds of people are currently waiting on the sidewalk outside St. Jude the Apostle Catholic Church here in Bowie, MD, as not one person has mustered the nerve to enter the polling place and cast a ballot. The long and winding line, which is already stretching from 8th Street to 11th Street, is filled with fearful and tentative citizens who are clearly trying to delay entering the voting booth. Many have reportedly waited three hours or more. Several of those outside the voting location confirmed that one individual did approach the front doors of the polling station at one point, but he got cold feet at the last minute, spun on his heels, and headed to the back of the line.

DENVER—Pausing a moment to pull up the information on her phone, area woman Robin Mizes, 32, figured she should quickly read up on the presidential nominees’ policy stances after casting her vote Tuesday, sources confirmed. “It’s probably a good idea to learn a little bit about the candidates and what they think about the issues,” said Mizes a few minutes after filling out her ballot and submitting it to poll workers, noting that she was particularly curious about the candidates’ tax plans and proposals for improving the economy. “So they’re both against this free trade plan, but Trump wants to get rid of Obamacare and Hillary doesn’t. And Hillary’s for more gun control. That’s good to know.” At press time, Mizes was reportedly considering looking up information on the down-ballot candidates she had already picked before shrugging her shoulders and deciding it would be too much of a hassle. Despite an abundance of variables that can alter the trajectory of Tuesday’s outcome, this election may come down to a single key factor: the number of votes each candidate gets. Put in layman’s terms, there is a direct correlation between whether a candidate wins or loses a particular state and the number of voters who cast their ballot for that candidate. How do we know? The Ballot Measure model relies heavily on two metrics to predict the outcome of the election. The first adjusts the electoral map to favor likely voters versus all registered voters, while also incorporating any statewide trends—or a “trendline adjustment”—based on polling in congressional races. The second uses a nonparametric regression—in other words, building a model based on the polling data we have, rather than fitting polling data into a predetermined model structure—in order to more accurately project the complex and continuously evolving interactions between electoral predictors. When combining those two metrics into our model, it’s clear just how significant winning more votes would be for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. If either HRC or DJT fails to record any more votes for the rest of the evening, their probability of reaching the threshold necessary to become president plummets dramatically. In fact, gaining more votes in all 50 states would provide a crucial boost for either candidate, whereas underestimating the impact of doing so could cost one of them the presidency. Here are the major questions I’ll be asking while projecting the results tonight: The answers will likely tell us whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.

NASHVILLE, TN—Complaining that there wasn’t even some sort of button to press, disappointed first-time voter Rob Blackman told reporters Tuesday he thought he was going to get to pull a big lever inside the voting booth. “I was sure there’d be a handle I’d have to really yank down on to officially cast my vote, and then there’d be this satisfying mechanical thunk sound,” said Blackman, 19, adding that quietly filling in bubbles on a sheet of paper was a “complete fucking letdown.” “I always thought you’d open up the curtain, see two big levers, and pull down on the one that corresponded to your candidate. But no, there was just a little table in there and that’s it. This is such bullshit.” Blackman went on to say that he wasn’t sure if he’d participate in another election since there really wasn’t an incentive for him to vote anymore. According to reports we’re receiving from correspondents across the country, voters in many locations are already forming long lines, which often extend out of their polling place and around the block, for the opportunity to completely eradicate the very foundations of our nation.

1684,"DENVER—Pausing a moment to pull up the information on her phone, area woman Robin Mizes, 32, figured she should quickly read up on the presidential nominees’ policy stances after casting her vote Tuesday, sources confirmed. “It’s probably a good idea to learn a little bit about the candidates and what they think about the issues,” said Mizes a few minutes after filling out her ballot and submitting it to poll workers, noting that she was particularly curious about the candidates’ tax plans and proposals for improving the economy. “So they’re both against this free trade plan, but Trump wants to get rid of Obamacare and Hillary doesn’t. And Hillary’s for more gun control. That’s good to know.” At press time, Mizes was reportedly considering looking up information on the down-ballot candidates she had already picked before shrugging her shoulders and deciding it would be too much of a hassle.

1685,"SALT LAKE CITY—Inquiring about several potential scenarios, Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson reportedly asked his campaign aides what their best path to 270 electoral votes was while they were in the midst of packing up the candidate’s headquarters Tuesday. “Okay, let’s think through the electoral map and see where our clearest shot at victory is,” said Johnson to top advisors who were taping shut cardboard boxes containing unsold campaign T-shirts, bumper stickers, and buttons reading “#LetGaryDebate.” “Have we gained any traction in Florida? That would give us a lot more wiggle room in New Hampshire and North Carolina. And if we got a strong early turnout in Alaska and South Dakota, that definitely moves us a lot closer to 270, if not beyond.” At press time, Johnson was muttering to himself about the western Mountain states in an empty office as his campaign staff went out back and threw everything into the dumpster."
1686,"NASHVILLE, TN—Complaining that there wasn’t even some sort of button to press, disappointed first-time voter Rob Blackman told reporters Tuesday he thought he was going to get to pull a big lever inside the voting booth. “I was sure there’d be a handle I’d have to really yank down on to officially cast my vote, and then there’d be this satisfying mechanical thunk sound,” said Blackman, 19, adding that quietly filling in bubbles on a sheet of paper was a “complete fucking letdown.” “I always thought you’d open up the curtain, see two big levers, and pull down on the one that corresponded to your candidate. But no, there was just a little table in there and that’s it. This is such bullshit.” Blackman went on to say that he wasn’t sure if he’d participate in another election since there really wasn’t an incentive for him to vote anymore.

I swear I know this,” said Patterson, squinting and placing her pen to her chin before sighing and looking up at the ceiling as she tried in vain to remember the virtues that America embodied. “I think freedom is definitely one of them, and, what is it—togetherness? No, dignity? Is that one? God, I’m totally screwed.” At press time, Patterson had completely panicked and filled out the rest of her ballot randomly."
1689,"WASHINGTON—Carefully weighing the pros and cons of their respective ballot measures before casting their votes, citizens in five states are set to decide tomorrow whether to legalize recreational marijuana or continue honoring God, sources confirmed Monday. “Constituents in California, Maine, Massachusetts, Arizona, and Nevada will have the choice tomorrow between advancing their pursuit of a godly life by adhering to Christ’s teachings and experiencing the glory of the Heavenly Father’s word, or allowing themselves and their neighbors to lawfully smoke marijuana,” said political analyst Kevin Phillips, who explained that while the advantages of passing these measures, such as bolstering the local economy and reducing prison overcrowding, could be substantial, they must be closely compared to the benefits of living in the light of the Divine Creator’s everlasting love. “After years of grassroots movements, voters will finally make this momentous choice for themselves: They can either permit adults over the age of 21 to use cannabis without legal consequence, or they can continue living in accordance with He who has made us in His own image and receiving God’s grace forever and ever.” At press time, the latest polls showed that the legalization of recreational marijuana and acceptance of an eternity of hellfire for forsaking the Almighty could potentially pass in all five states."

1691,"It’s been quite a campaign, hasn’t it? Just think of all that has happened over the past 16 months. I’ve traveled all over the country, spoken to millions of people, and my campaign has gotten the entire nation talking about illegal immigrants, radical Islamic terror, violent crime, and so much more. Obviously, nothing would make me happier than for Americans to go to the polls and choose me as their next president. But regardless of what our nation decides tomorrow, at least I can say that I had fun. Whether I win or lose, the bottom line is that this whole thing has been a really, really good time for me. Honestly, I enjoyed every minute of it. If I don’t get to keep challenging the place of women, minorities, the disabled, people of different faiths, and fact-based journalists in our society after tomorrow, then no sweat. I can just walk away knowing it was a nice time while it lasted. Right from the beginning, when I announced my candidacy, I stirred up all kinds of deep-seated passions with my remarks about Mexican Americans, and I still can’t help but smile every time I think back on it. That was fun. Some people condemned me, others praised me, and many spent months of their lives closely considering what I had said and attempting to determine how my words, if carried into policy, would affect millions of people. But me, I just got to say it, which was fun, and watch people react to it, which was also fun. And that was just the beginning, of course. I came up with a ban on Muslim immigrants. I participated in a bunch of debates. I even got to set much of the Republican Party’s 2016 platform, laying out how one of the nation’s two major parties would govern 320 million people if I were elected. Talk about a great time. Sure, coming up with policies that would impact large swaths of the population, affect every corner of our economy, and alter the direction of the nation for decades to come was an honor, but really, it was more than that: It was a fun way to pass the time. Honestly, one of the most fun things I’ve ever done. Just think about it: Everyone in the country had to listen to me lay out my vision for America every day for months and months and months. And ultimately, it’s not that big a deal either way whether people choose to accept it or reject it at the polls, because in the end, I had a total blast. And that’s what’s most important to me. Looking back on it now, it’s hard to list all the times I got a kick out of this campaign. There were all the times I talked or tweeted about border walls, the role of women, rounding families up, media bias, gun deaths in our cities, defaulting on the national debt, disregarding treaties, using nuclear weapons, and on and on. People seemed to get really worked up about all that stuff, which was a ton of fun to watch. I’m not always sure where I came up with those talking points, but if I’m being honest, that was part of the fun. Believe me when I say that all the chanting, all the rallies, all the thinkpieces, all the online discussions, all the canvassing, all the strongly worded op-eds, and all the confrontations between people on either side was, at the end of the day, just really satisfying, and something no one can ever take away from me. So you can see how, even if I don’t wind up with the most electoral votes in the general election, this has all been very worthwhile for me on an individual level. Will I be disappointed if Hillary Clinton wins? Of course. But did I have fun? Yes, I did. So there’s that. And if I don’t get to keep challenging the place of women, minorities, the disabled, people of different faiths, and fact-based journalists in our society after tomorrow, then no sweat. I can just walk away knowing it was a nice time while it lasted. But don’t be surprised, though, if come Wednesday morning, I’m carrying on about how the election was rigged, or saying whatever else I can to keep the good times rolling. I’m a guy who likes having fun, and I’m pretty sure I can keep having my fun by making any claim I like about the electoral system, or political corruption, or the Constitution, or the press’s role in all this, or the active subversion of the people’s will by a shadowy cabal of elites. In fact, that sounds like it would be a ton of fun—I bet I could keep that kind of fun going for many more months, if not years. And you know what? No matter what happens, thanks for being a part of this with me. I couldn’t have had all this fun without you."

1693,"WASHINGTON—Playing down any hope that they would draw a single valuable insight from the current election cycle, voters across the nation admitted Saturday they are probably going to come out of this whole thing having learned the completely wrong lessons. “We should definitely have learned something substantive about the dangers of political polarization or even social media echo chambers, but we’re almost certainly going to end up walking away from this with some other conclusion that’s way, way off-base,” said Atlanta resident Tyler Gore, 34, adding that no amount of hindsight would enable him and millions of his fellow citizens to extract a meaningful takeaway about the country’s political discourse. “We’re definitely going to claim that we gained some new understanding from this election, but it’s far more likely to be some nonsense about the media manipulating polls than a real lesson about, say, our primary system empowering the most extreme voters. Whatever happens, I guarantee we are not getting this right.” At press time, the nation also acknowledged that on the off chance it did learn a useful lesson from this election, it would surely forget it by the next one."
1694,"NEW YORK—With just days remaining before the nation heads to the polls, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reportedly crisscrossed the country this weekend in a frenzied last-minute push to appeal to white voters. “White outreach is going to be at the center of our campaign during these final few days of the election—we really want white audiences to know they have a friend and advocate in Donald Trump,” said Trump’s communications director, Hope Hicks, explaining that the campaign was spending $7 million on advertising targeted at white households in addition to scheduling a whirlwind series of campaign stops in predominantly white cities and neighborhoods as part of their eleventh-hour effort to engage the voting bloc. “Mr. Trump will visit white churches and businesses in several states, conveying a hopeful message to the nation’s Caucasians that tomorrow will be brighter. We want white people, and in particular, white men, to recognize that they have a voice in this campaign, and we want to assure them that Donald Trump understands the white community’s concerns and will never stop fighting for them as president.” Hicks said she expected the nominee’s message of compassion to resonate deeply with white Americans, stating that it comes from a real place in Trump’s heart."

I can’t get this part out of the other thing. I’m pulling on it a lot, but it’s not working.

1696,"ATKINSON, NH—Warning supporters that the troubling practice could affect the outcome of the election, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump expressed strong concern Friday that members of urban communities were voting more than zero times, sources reported. “I’ve heard stories that some of these people in the inner cities are trying to steal the election by casting over zero ballots—we can’t let this happen, folks,” said Trump, who claimed that hundreds of urban voting precincts across the country often have turnout numbers that are far higher than zero percent of eligible voters. “Very trustworthy sources have told me that in many of these urban neighborhoods, people are voting in excess of zero times by mailing in a ballot under their own name or even just by walking right up to a polling place and voting without a problem—and the poll workers there will just go along with it. It’s a terrible thing that’s happening in those places, and it needs to be stopped.” Trump added that concerned supporters should form groups, head to urban precincts, and “do what needs to be done” to take care of the problem."
1697,"WASHINGTON—Saying they felt anxious and overwhelmed just days before heading to the polls to decide a historically fraught presidential race, Americans throughout the country reportedly took a moment Thursday to put the 2016 election into perspective by reminding themselves that some species of sea turtles are eaten by birds just seconds after they hatch. “I’ve been worrying so much lately about what will happen on Election Day that I finally just made myself pause, take a deep breath, and remember there are some sea turtles out there who, immediately after hatching, get eaten by pelicans before they can even crawl from the beach into the ocean, and that allowed me to calm down a bit and place this whole election into proper context,” said 49-year-old Ellen Weaver of Binghamton, NY, who, like tens of millions of her fellow citizens, coped with the stress brought on by tightening polls, nonstop media coverage, and the candidates’ last-minute attacks on one another by repeatedly telling herself that of the 50 to 200 baby sea turtles born to one nest, it is a rarity if even one or two survive, as research indicates that only one in 1,000 hatchlings will make it to adulthood. “Even though I’m afraid of how this might turn out and have serious doubts about whether our country can continue functioning after all this, I know that loggerhead turtles incubate inside their eggs for around two months, and more often than not, the very moment they emerge into the world to begin their lives, they’re scooped up in a vulture’s beak and swallowed whole alongside many of their brothers and sisters. When you take a step back and really consider that even if these turtles do make it to the water, they’ll then have to spend the next few years of their lives hoping they don’t get eaten by any number of fish while they’re being pulled around by currents until they’re large enough to swim to shore on their own, you start to see the election with clearer eyes.” After pondering the sea turtles’ fate for several more minutes, the nation reportedly began to feel less comforted and started growing jealous that the turtles at least get to have everything be over with quickly."
1698,"WASHINGTON—According to a report released Thursday by the Pew Research Center, Election Day 2016 will, for the majority of Americans, mark the only time this year they will occupy the same room as a person who supports a different presidential candidate. “For the majority of those backing either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, this upcoming Tuesday will be the first and last time in 2016 they will share the same enclosed physical space with someone whose viewpoints fall on the opposite side of the political spectrum,” the report read in part, noting that on average, American voters will spend 18 minutes this year in the physical presence of those who would prefer a different outcome in the election, beginning from the moment they enter their local polling place on November 8, to the moment they submit their ballot and exit the premises. “Furthermore, the typically brief intervals spent waiting in line to cast one’s vote will represent the only point in 2016 when most voters with differing opinions on the issues and disparate desires for the direction of the nation will be within several feet of one another, a distance from which they could, theoretically, engage in a normal conversation.” The report went on to state that as soon as they left the shared space on Election Day, tens of millions of Americans would go back to their regular interactions with those supporting the other candidate by brutally vilifying them and questioning their intelligence on social media."

1701,"WASHINGTON—Saying the circumstances of this year’s presidential race made the upgrade necessary, election commissions throughout the country were reportedly working to install new heavy-duty voting machines this week that will allow Americans to physically take out their frustrations on the devices before casting their votes. According to Premier Election Solutions, the manufacturer of the new Citadel electronic voting machine, each unit features an easy-to-navigate interface, keeps accurate and secure tallies of votes, and is constructed with durable Kevlar buttons, a shatter-resistant Plexiglas screen, and a reinforced titanium housing, ensuring the devices are able to endure sustained blunt force trauma from voters’ fists and elbows as well as repeated puncturing attempts from sharp objects wielded by exasperated citizens. “These new voting machines were designed specifically with the 2016 election in mind and have been engineered to withstand everything the nation’s voters will bring at them on Election Day,” said company spokesperson Stephen Dunn, who also noted that the units’ Teflon coating makes it easy to wipe down all the sweat and saliva that will accumulate on their surface when they are being repeatedly pummeled in fits of anger. “When 18 months of disgust finally culminate inside the nation’s voting booths, these machines will be able to absorb every punch, kick, and knee drop citizens can dish out while still reliably tabulating totals for all local, state, and national races.” “Like millions of other Americans, I know that I’ll be ready to unload my pent-up rage next Tuesday,” Dunn added. “And our machines will be ready too.” According to Dunn, the Citadel underwent numerous revisions during testing, as a series of early designs proved incapable of withstanding voters’ increasing level of aggravation as the election progressed. Engineers are said to have quickly pulled their prototypes from preliminary field tests during the Virginia and Minnesota primaries upon learning the device’s original plastic housing was splintering to pieces following sharp headbutts from as few as three successive voters. Additionally, internal modifications were reportedly made after Super Tuesday to more securely solder the processor and wiring into place so the unit would maintain functionality each time it was thrown to the ground by a red-faced, screaming voter and continuously kicked for 35 minutes straight. In a later trial during the Wisconsin primary, when the Republican field had been effectively whittled down to just Ted Cruz and Donald Trump, Dunn said the design team came up with the idea to attach an aluminum baseball bat to the side of the machine with a steel cord, noting that if they didn’t provide voters with a convenient weapon, they would physically rip the unit’s legs off and beat it with those to the point of exhaustion. “Our test models were really pushed to their physical limits during the New Jersey primary in June when it was more or less clear that the country would be left with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as its two choices for president,” said Dunn, explaining that the devices had to survive all-out, abusive barrages from every voter who entered their testing precincts in Passaic County. “Thankfully, we had incorporated military-grade armor plating into the machines by that point, which proved able to sustain everything from being repeatedly smashed up against a cinder-block gymnasium wall to being dragged up and then pushed down flights of church basement stairs several times in a row.” “Of course, that was the night we learned we needed to make the touchscreen bulletproof, though,” Dunn continued. According to poll workers, excitement about the new machines appears to have increased voter turnout in the general election, with early voting up by as much as 30 percent in states where the units have already been installed, forcing many polling places to institute time limits on how long voters can batter, stomp on, and bite the units in raving bouts of hysterics. “It was nice to get in there and finally cast my ballot,” said 55-year-old Gordon Mulner, an early voter in Fredericksburg, VA, panting heavily as he wiped away the sheen of sweat from his brow with his raw, bleeding knuckles. “I had to wait in line a little while, but it was worth it. It felt good to make my voice heard.” “I think I broke my hand,” he added. At press time, election officials were scrambling to chain the machines to precinct walls, as it became apparent they would need to prevent voters from lugging them into the parking lot and repeatedly backing over them with their cars."
1702,"NEW YORK—In an effort to prepare for any new revelations that might emerge about her emails during her tenure as secretary of state, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly told her staff Tuesday to ready the launch of several electromagnetic pulses to disable all of the nation’s electronic devices. “If there are additional leaks, I’m going to need you to head directly to the command center in the basement of our headquarters, input your security authorization, and turn the EMP launch key,” said Clinton to her top advisors, explaining that detonating the missile-mounted thermonuclear warheads in the mid-stratosphere above Kansas, New York, and Los Angeles would immediately wipe out all electronic communications within the continental United States and much of Canada. “Every hard drive, server, and data center within the blast radius should be permanently erased. However, if we detect any remaining electronic signals in the fallout, we should be prepared to use the backup EMPs from our stockpile. The go word is ‘trustworthy.’” At press time, the Clinton campaign was targeting an additional EMP to explode over a row of unmarked warehouses in Moscow."
1703,"WASHINGTON—Saying that at this point, they were just taking their best guesses at how they should react to each new scandal that emerged about the presidential nominees, voters across the country admitted Monday they had no clue how outraged they are supposed to be about anything anymore. “It seems like there’s a new revelation that comes out each day about Trump or Hillary, and to be honest, I couldn’t even begin to tell you which ones I should just shake my head at and which ones are worth actually getting worked up about,” said Tempe, AZ voter Jeffrey Wilborne, who noted that between the recent breaking news alerts he received about the FBI reopening an investigation into Clinton’s emails just days ahead of the election and the barrage of apoplectic posts from friends on Facebook aimed at either the Democratic candidate or the FBI director, it was hard enough to tell which side to actually be resentful toward, let alone how angry to get. “I felt like it was pretty clear that I should be mad at Trump for what he said on that bus and at Hillary for telling Wall Street completely different things than she was telling us. But what about all that Clinton Foundation stuff? Should I be furious or just let that slide? I’m completely lost over here.” At press time, the nation’s electorate had settled on being completely apathetic to everything from here on out."
1704,"BROOKLYN, NY—In response to the FBI’s announcement that its investigation of him had produced new evidence that could pertain to its probe of the Democratic presidential nominee, Anthony Weiner reportedly sent an apology sext early Monday morning to the entire Hillary Clinton campaign. “Just wanted u 2 know I am so so sorry for the mess I caused everybody,” read the first of several group text messages that Weiner sent to over two dozen top campaign staffers between the hours of 1 a.m. and 2 a.m., a series that reportedly also included a grainy close-up photograph of the former congressman’s right nipple, several images of his erect penis protruding from his boxer briefs, and a fully nude selfie taken in front of a bathroom mirror on which he had written the phrase “I’m a bad boy” in lipstick. “U know I’d do just about anything to patch things up. I just hope nobody over there wants to give me a spanking! So hard right now.” At press time, sources confirmed that Weiner was speaking to the angry father of the 13-year-old girl whose number is reportedly one digit off from that of Clinton campaign manager John Podesta."
1705,"WASHINGTON—Claiming it felt queasy just thinking about what the cause could be, the nation’s populace said Monday it was too terrified to look at what Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s recent rise in the polls was attributed to. “I know that he just got a pretty big bounce, but frankly, I don’t think I can handle any more information than that,” said Salem, OR resident Tina Redmond, one of the millions of Americans who had learned of Trump’s 2.5-point increase over the previous week’s polling and were too frightened to find out why. “Once I heard that number, I just couldn’t bear even one more detail. I know if I see a single word of explanation, I won’t sleep for a week—it’s just too horrifying.” At press time, the nation had learned that support for third-party candidates remained high among millennials and was scared to death of hearing anything further."
1706,"WALDPORT, OR—A team of anthropologists announced Friday it had discovered an isolated tribe of blissful Americans who have never been exposed to the current presidential campaign or its candidates, noting that the newly identified population lives contentedly in a remote village completely untouched by the 2016 race. According to researchers from Lewis & Clark College, the peaceful, secluded community along the outskirts of Oregon’s Drift Creek Wilderness remains uncontacted by political canvassers, pollsters, and the election media, allowing its generally cheerful and affable inhabitants to go about their daily lives without ever encountering a political poll, election news story, campaign ad, soundbite, or stump speech. “Upon first entering the village, we immediately noticed how relaxed and upbeat the inhabitants appeared, but it wasn’t until speaking with them directly that we understood how insulated they were from the country’s political climate,” said professor Elizabeth Letts, adding that the tribe’s levels of stress, depression, and anxiety were far lower than those recorded over the past 18 months among the broader American populace. “They actually seem to lead gratifying, well-balanced lives. The adults enjoy eight hours of sleep each night, and in place of discussing politics or the latest revelations about the candidates, they were seen regularly smiling or laughing—not cynically, or as a defense mechanism, even, but out of genuine joy.” “In my 30 years studying human cultures, I’ve never come across a people so happy,” she continued. According to Letts, when tribe members were asked their thoughts on major-party candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, they looked puzzled for a moment and then shrugged their shoulders before grinning warmly and continuing on with their day. Similarly, villagers reportedly appeared confused but at ease when asked about the national mood, saying that as far as they could tell, people were feeling pretty good about everything. The anthropologists confirmed this sense of tranquility permeated all aspects of life in the tribe, observing that when extended families gathered for mealtimes, the tenor of their conversation remained pleasant and amicable, with no subjects deemed off-limits. Moreover, scientists noted that the village lacked any signage, clothing, or other paraphernalia bearing divisive words or imagery, and residents appeared to trust one another and appreciate time spent interacting. “When I brought out my iPad to show them footage of the recent presidential debates, they immediately became agitated, and several of the children started to cry,” said graduate student Lester Reinhold, who explained that the perplexed villagers kept asking him why the people on the screen interrupted each other so often when they didn’t even have anything of value to say. “I explained that one of the two people onstage would be their next leader, and they all gasped and recoiled in horror, with many saying they didn’t see how that could possibly be true.” “I then tried showing them an attack ad about Donald Trump’s comments and actions toward women, but many of them became terrified and began screaming—that’s when one of the village elders swatted the tablet out of my hand,” he added. “After seeing how upset it made them, I determined that it was in their best interest to keep all audio and video clips from the election cycle away from them for the rest of our onsite study.” Scientists noted that when they surveyed members of the tribe about their expectations for the future, specifically after November 8, the responses they received were universally optimistic. Every villager, regardless of age, gender, or social status within the community, reportedly mentioned how they anticipated things would continue to go as well as they had been going. When asked to name the most pressing issue facing them, a few members of the group reportedly admitted, however, that it had been raining a lot lately, and that a little sunshine might be nice. “This is a perfectly preserved community, probably the last of its kind anywhere,” said Letts, who expressed concern that outside forces such as the ever-lengthening campaign season and an increase of on-the-ground political operatives in the area threatened to encroach on the tribe’s simpler and more satisfying way of life. “Even though they’re disconnected from much of the modern-day world and the daily news cycle, these individuals seemed to possess something we don’t: a true sense of delight and positivity toward everyday existence, like each new day is a gift to be cherished.” “Our society could learn a lot from these people,” she added. At press time, sources confirmed a campaign bus could be seen winding its way down a wooded road toward the village."
